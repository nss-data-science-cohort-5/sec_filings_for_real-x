and 0%, respectively, of our net revenue for our fiscal year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”).</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">As of
July&nbsp;31, 2021, our Mountain segment operates thirty-seven

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
ongoing impacts of COVID-19 resulted in reduced visitation and
decreased spending for the 2020/2021 North American ski season
compared to the prior year through March 14, 2021, the date that we
closed our Resorts early for the 2019/2020 North American ski
season due to the outbreak of COVID-19. These declines were
primarily driven by reduced demand for out-of-state and
international (“Destination”) visitation at our western resorts and
COVID-19 related capacity limitations. However, Destination
visitation improved as the season progressed. Whistler Blackcomb’s
performance was negatively impacted due to the continued closure of
the Canadian border to international guests, including guests from
the U.S., and was further impacted by the resort closing earlier
than expected on March 30, 2021 following a provincial health order
issued by the government of British Columbia. Two of our Australian
ski areas, Mount Hotham and Falls Creek, opened for their 2020
winter season on July 6, 2020, but we decided to close them four
days later due to a “stay at home” order put in place by the
Victorian government and specifically for the Melbourne
metropolitan area, which represents the majority of visitors for
Mount Hotham and Falls Creek, as a result of a reemergence of
COVID-19 in the region. Our Australian ski areas were also impacted
by “stay at home” orders and periodic resort closures during their
2021 ski seasons. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse
impact on our results of operations for Fiscal 2021, and may
continue to have a material, negative impact on our resorts for the
fiscal year ending July 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”).</span></div>

Industry/Competition</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">There
are approximately 745 ski areas in North America with approximately
460 in the U.S., ranging from small ski area operations that
service day skiers to large resorts that attract both day skiers
and destination resort guests looking for a comprehensive vacation
experience. During the 2020/2021 North American ski season,
combined skier visits for all ski areas in North America were
approximately 74.5&nbsp;million, which was lower than historical
levels due to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, particularly with
regard to Destination visitation. During the 2018/2019 North
American ski season (the ski season immediately prior to the
outbreak of COVID-19), combined skier visits for all ski areas in
North America were approximately 79.7 million. Our North American
Resorts had approximately 13.9 million skier visits during the
2020/2021 ski season, representing approximately 18.7% of North
American skier visits.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">There
is limited opportunity for development of new destination ski
resorts due to the limited private lands on which ski areas can be
built, the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate governmental
approvals to build on public lands and the significant capital
needed to construct the necessary infrastructure. As such, there
have been virtually no new destination ski resorts in North America
for over 40 years, which has allowed and should continue to allow
the best-positioned destination resorts to benefit from future
industry growth. Our resorts compete with other major destination
mountain resorts, including, among others, Aspen Snowmass, Copper
Mountain, Mammoth, Deer Valley, Snowbird, Squaw Valley USA,
Killington, Sierra at Tahoe, Steamboat, Jackson Hole and Winter
Park, as well as other ski areas in Colorado, California, Nevada,
Utah, the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Southwest and British
Columbia, Canada, and other destination ski areas worldwide as well
as non-ski related vacation options and destinations. Additionally,
our pass products compete with other multi-resort frequency and
pass products in North America, including the IKON Pass, the
Mountain Collective Pass and various regional and local pass
products.</span></div>

Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions,

data-driven marketing analytics and personalized marketing
capabilities, we target increased penetration of ski pass products,
providing our guests with a strong value proposition in return for
guests committing to ski at our resorts prior to, or very early
into the ski season, which we believe attracts more guests to our
resorts. We believe we invest in more capital improvements than our

our snowmaking systems in Colorado that transformed the
early-season terrain experience at Vail, Keystone and Beaver Creek.
Our other ski areas receive less snowfall than our western North

<div class="mtn20210731htm110"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
focus is to provide quality service at every touch point of the
guest journey. Prior to arrival at our mountain resorts, guests can
receive personal assistance through our full-service, central
reservations group and through our comprehensive websites to book
desired lodging accommodations, lift tickets and pass products, ski
school lessons, equipment rentals, activities and other resort
services. Upon arrival, our resort staff serve as ambassadors to
engage guests, answer questions and create a customer-focused
environment. We offer EpicMix, an online and mobile application
that, through radio frequency technology, captures a guest’s
activity on the mountain (e.g. number of ski days, vertical feet
skied and chairlift activity); allows a guest to share his or her
experience, photos and accomplishments with family and friends on
social networks; allows guests to access real time lift line wait
times; and allows our ski school instructors to certify the
attainment of certain skills and ski levels. We also offer the
world’s first digital mountain assistant (“EMMA”), which uses
artificial intelligence and natural language processing to offer
information on everything from grooming, lift line wait times and
parking, in addition to recommendations on rentals, lessons and
dining options. We have also invested in lift ticket express
fulfillment through new mobile technology by allowing lift ticket
purchasers that buy online to bypass the ticket window.
Additionally, we are focused on improving the guest ski/snowboard
rental experience by eliminating the need for a guest to wait in
several lines with the recent introduction of a new “pod” concept
in several of our high-volume locations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm110"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
also solicit guest feedback through a variety of surveys and
results, which are used to ensure high levels of customer
satisfaction, understand trends and develop future resort programs
and amenities. We then utilize this guest feedback to help us focus
our capital spending and operational efforts to the areas of the
greatest need.</span></div>

Pass & Epic Day Pass Products</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm110"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
offer a variety of pass products, primarily season pass and Epic
Day Pass products, for all of our Resorts that are marketed towards
both Destination guests as well as in-state and local (“Local”)
guests. These pass products are available for purchase prior to the
start of the ski season, offering our guests a better value in
exchange for their commitment to ski at our Resorts before the
season begins. For the 2020/2021 North American ski season, we
reduced the prices of our entire portfolio of pass products by 20%.
Our pass program drives strong customer loyalty and mitigates
exposure to more weather sensitive guests, leading to greater
revenue stability and allowing us to capture valuable guest data.
Additionally, our pass product customers typically ski more days
each season than those guests who do not buy pass products, which
leads to additional ancillary spending. In addition, our pass
products attract new guests to our Resorts. Our pass products
generated approximately 61% of our total lift revenue for Fiscal
2021, which includes the impact of approximately $120.9 million of
pass product revenue which was deferred from Fiscal 2020 and
recognized primarily in Fiscal 2021 as a result of pass credits
that we offered to 2019/2020 pass holders who renewed for the
2020/2021 ski season. Sales of pass products are a key component of
our overall Mountain segment revenue and help create strong
synergies among our Resorts. Our pass products range from providing
access for a certain number of days to one or a combination of our
Resorts to our Epic Pass, which provides unrestricted and unlimited
access to all of our Resorts. The Epic Day Pass is a customizable
one to seven day pass product purchased in advance of the season,
for those skiers and riders who expect to ski a certain number of
days during the season, and which is available in two tiers of
resort offerings. All of our various pass product options can be
found on our consumer website www.snow.com. Information on our
websites does not constitute part of this document.</span></div>

part of our continued strategy to drive pass product sales and
create a stronger connection between key skier markets and our
iconic destination mountain resorts, we have continued to expand
our portfolio of properties in recent years. In September 2019, we
acquired Peak Resorts, Inc., which added 17 regional ski areas
strategically located near key U.S. population centers in the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. In April 2019, we
acquired Falls Creek and Hotham, located in Victoria, Australia,
expanding our portfolio of Australian ski resorts to complement
Perisher, which we acquired in June 2015. Stevens Pass in
Washington State (acquired in August 2018) is located 85 miles from
Seattle and 250 miles from Whistler Blackcomb, a world-renowned
international skiing destination which typically receives more than
two million skier visits each year. We have also made strategic
acquisitions of mountain resorts located in the Northeast U.S.
recently, including Okemo in Vermont (acquired in September 2018)
and Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire (both acquired in September
2018). These ski areas are premier, high-end ski destinations for
skiers and snowboarders on the East Coast, which draw visitors from
New York City, Boston and the broader Northeast skier population.

alliance agreements with third-</span></div>

products, regardless of whether guests plan to ski one day or every
day of the season.&nbsp;Additionally, in April 2020 we introduced
Epic Coverage, which is included with the purchase of all pass
products for no additional charge. Epic Coverage provides refunds
in the event of certain resort closures and certain travel
restrictions (e.g. for COVID-19), giving pass holders a refund for
any portion of the season that is lost due to qualifying
circumstances. Additionally, Epic Coverage provides a refund for
qualifying personal circumstances that were historically covered by

losses and many other personal events.</span></div>

season, in addition to our exceptional ski experiences, guests can
choose from a variety of non-ski related activities such as
snowtubing, snowshoeing, guided snowmobile and scenic snow cat
tours, backcountry expeditions, horse-drawn sleigh rides and high
altitude dining, although some of these activities were restricted
or limited for the most recent winter season to ensure the safety
of our guests and employees as a result of COVID-19. During a
normal summer season, our mountain resorts offer non-ski related
recreational activities and provide guests with a wide array of
options including scenic chairlift and gondola rides, mountain
biking, horseback riding, guided hiking, 4x4 Jeep tours, and our
Epic Discovery program at Vail Mountain, Heavenly and Breckenridge,
although some of these activities were restricted or limited for
both the 2020 and 2021 summer seasons to ensure the safety of our
guests and employees as a result of COVID-19. The Epic Discovery
program encourages “learn through play” by featuring extensive
environmental educational elements interspersed between numerous
activities, consisting of zip lines, children’s activities,
challenge ropes courses, tubing, mountain excursions, an alpine
slide and alpine coasters.</span></div>

through our ownership or management of lodging properties and

management of luxury resorts in premier destination

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Hotels
are categorized by Smith Travel Research, a leading lodging
industry research firm, as luxury, upper upscale, upscale,
mid-price and economy. The service quality and level of
accommodations of our RockResorts’ hotels place them in the luxury
segment, which represents hotels achieving the highest average
daily rates (“ADR”) in the industry, and includes such brands as
the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott’s Luxury Collection
hotels. Our other hotels are categorized in the upper upscale and
upscale segments of the hotel market. The luxury and upper upscale
segments consist of approximately 763,000 rooms at approximately
2,400 properties in the U.S. as of July&nbsp;31, 2021. For Fiscal
2021, our owned hotels, which include a combination of certain
RockResort hotels as well as other hotels in proximity to our
Resorts, had an overall ADR of $264.83, a paid occupancy rate of
46.2% and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of $122.45, as
compared to the upper upscale segment’s ADR of $155.53, a paid
occupancy rate of 37.8% and RevPAR of $58.85. We believe that this
comparison to the upper upscale segment is appropriate as our mix
of owned hotels include those in the luxury and upper upscale
segments, as well as certain of our hotels that fall in the upscale
segment. The highly seasonal nature of our lodging properties
typically results in lower average occupancy as compared to the
upper upscale segment of the lodging industry as a whole, although
this was not the case during Fiscal 2021 as a result of the
significant impacts of COVID-19 on the broader lodging
industry.</span></div>

on December 31, 2021. In June 2021, we agreed to an amendment to
the agreement extending the term an additional two years, with an
expiration date of December 31, 2023. We also own Flagg Ranch,
located in Moran, Wyoming and centrally&nbsp;located between
Yellowstone National Park and&nbsp;Grand Teton National
Park&nbsp;on the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway (the
“Parkway”). Flagg Ranch operates under a concessionaire agreement
with the NPS that expires October 31, 2028. GTLC also owns Jackson
Hole Golf & Tennis Club (“JHG&amp;TC”), located outside Grand Teton
National Park near Jackson, Wyoming. GTLC’s operations within Grand
Teton National Park and JHG&amp;TC have operating seasons that
generally run from June through the end of September.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
primarily compete with such companies as Aramark Parks & Resorts,
Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, Forever Resorts and
Xanterra Parks & Resorts in retaining and obtaining NPS
concessionaire agreements. Four full-service concessionaires
provide accommodations within Grand Teton National Park, including
GTLC. In a normal operating season, GTLC offers three lodging
options within Grand Teton National Park: Jackson Lake Lodge, a
full-service, 385-room resort with 17,000 square feet of conference
facilities; Jenny Lake Lodge, a small, rustically elegant retreat
with 37 cabins; and Colter Bay Village, a facility with 166 log
cabins, 66 tent cabins, 337 campsites and a 112-space recreational
vehicle park. GTLC offers dining options as extensive as its
lodging options, with cafeterias, casual eateries and fine dining
establishments. GTLC’s resorts provide a wide range of activities
for guests to enjoy, including cruises on Jackson Lake, boat
rentals, horseback riding, guided fishing, float trips, golf and
guided Grand Teton National Park tours. As a result of the
extensive amenities offered, as well as the tremendous popularity
of the National Park System, GTLC’s accommodations within Grand
Teton National Park operate near full capacity during their
operating season.</span></div>

Estate Segment</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
have extensive holdings of real property at our mountain resorts
primarily throughout Summit and Eagle Counties in Colorado. Our
real estate operations, through Vail Resorts Development Company
(“VRDC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, include planning, oversight,
infrastructure improvement, development, marketing and sale of our
real property holdings. In addition to the cash flow generated from
real estate development sales, these development activities benefit
our Mountain and Lodging segments by (1) creating additional resort
lodging and other resort related facilities and venues (primarily
restaurants, spas, commercial space, private mountain clubs, skier
services facilities and parking structures) that provide us with
the opportunity to create new sources of recurring revenue, enhance
the guest experience and expand our destination bed base; (2)
controlling the architectural themes of our resorts; and (3)
expanding our property management and commercial leasing
operations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
principal activities of our Real Estate segment include the sale of
land parcels to third-party developers and planning for future real
estate development projects, including zoning and acquisition of
applicable permits. We continue undertaking preliminary planning
and design work on future projects and are pursuing opportunities
with third-party developers rather than</span></div>

our financial risk.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm77">Marketing and Sales</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
Mountain segment’s marketing and sales efforts are focused on
leveraging marketing analytics to drive targeted and personalized
marketing to our existing and prospective guests. We capture guest
data on the vast majority of guest transactions through sales of
our pass products, our e-commerce platforms including mobile lift
ticket sales, the EpicMix application and our lift ticket windows.
We promote our Resorts using guest-centric omni-channel marketing
campaigns leveraging email, direct mail, promotional programs,
digital marketing (including social, search and display) and
traditional media advertising where appropriate (e.g. targeted
print, TV and radio). We also have marketing programs directed at
attracting groups, corporate meetings and convention business. Most
of our marketing efforts drive traffic to our websites, where we
provide our guests with information regarding each of our Resorts,
including services and amenities, reservations information, virtual
tours and the opportunity to book/purchase our full suite of
products (e.g. lift access, lodging, ski school, rentals, etc.) for
their visits.&nbsp;We also enter into strategic alliances with
companies to enhance the guest experience at our Resorts, as well
as to create opportunities for cross-marketing.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">For
our Lodging segment, we promote our hotels and lodging properties
through marketing and sales programs, which include marketing
directly to many of our guests through our digital channels
(search, social and display), promotional programs, and print media
advertising, all of which are designed to drive traffic to our
websites and central reservations call center. We also promote
comprehensive vacation experiences through various package
offerings and promotions (combining lodging, lift tickets, ski
school lessons, ski rental equipment, transportation and dining).
In addition, our hotels have active sales forces to generate
conference and group business. We market our resort properties in
conjunction with our mountain resort marketing efforts where
appropriate, given the strong synergies across the two
businesses.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Across
both the Mountain and Lodging segments, sales made through our
websites and call center allow us to transact directly with our
guests, which further expands our customer base and enables
analytics to deliver an increasingly guest-centric marketing
experience.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm77">Seasonality</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Ski
resort operations are highly seasonal in nature, with a typical ski
season in North America generally beginning in mid-November and
running through mid-April. In an effort to partially mitigate the
concentration of our revenue in the winter months in North America,
we offer several non-ski related activities in the summer months
such as sightseeing, mountain biking, guided hiking, 4x4 Jeep
tours, golf (included in the operations of the Lodging segment) and
our Epic Discovery program. These activities also help attract
destination conference and group business to our Resorts in our
off-season. In addition, the operating results of our Australian
Resorts, for which the ski season generally occurs from June
through early October, partially counterbalances the concentration
of our revenues during this seasonally lower period in North
America.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
lodging business is also highly seasonal in nature, with peak
seasons primarily in the winter months (with the exception of GTLC,
Flagg Ranch, certain managed properties and mountain resort golf
operations). We actively promote our extensive conference
facilities and have added more off-season activities to help offset
the seasonality of our lodging business. Additionally, we operate
several golf courses proximate to our Resorts, as described
above.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm77">Sustainability & Social
Responsibility</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Sustainability remains a core philosophy for us.
As a company rooted in the great outdoors, we have a unique
responsibility to protect and preserve the incredible environments
in which we operate. Through our corporate sustainability and
social responsibility program, EpicPromise, we focus on climate
change mitigation, resource conservation, and building stronger
local communities through contributions to local non-profit
organizations. Our sustainability efforts are diverse and touch
nearly every area of our operations. In 2017, we launched
Commitment to Zero, our pledge to have a zero net operating
footprint by 2030. This commitment includes (i) achieving zero net
emissions by finding operational energy efficiencies, investing in
renewable energy and investing in offsets and other emissions
reduction projects, (ii) zero waste to landfill by diverting 100%
of waste from our operations, and (iii) zero net operating impact
to forests and habitat by restoring an acre of forest for every
acre displaced by our operations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">As a
result of this commitment, Vail Resorts was accepted as the first
travel and tourism company into RE100, a collaborative initiative
uniting more than 300 global and influential businesses committed
to 100% renewable electricity. During Fiscal 2021, we continued to
make progress toward our Commitment to Zero goals, despite
operational adjustments made in response to COVID-19. Specifically,
we focused on maintaining our robust composting and recycling
diversion programs as much as</span></div>

seven resorts. In Colorado and Utah, we drove a pilot project to
recycle snack wrappers and worked with strategic partners to create
picnic tables, Adirondack chairs and a terrain park feature made
from recycled wrappers and bottles for participating resorts. The
82-turbine Plum Creek Wind project we enabled came online in June
2020, and in Fiscal 2021 we purchased approximately 281,000
megawatt hours (MWh) of wind energy, addressing an estimated 85% of
the Company’s current electricity use across its 34 North American
destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">For
over two years, Vail Resorts has worked with leaders from other ski
companies to develop an industry-driven climate commitment. In June
2021 we, alongside Alterra Mountain Company, Boyne Resorts, and
POWDR, announced the Climate Collaborative Charter - the ski
industry’s first unified effort to combat climate change. This
partnership leverages our leadership in sustainability and is
expected to accelerate our collective progress, leading the
industry toward long-term transformational change.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
addition, during Fiscal 2021, we sponsored the reforestation of
acreage in the White River National Forest in Colorado that was
devastated in a 2017 wildfire, which addressed 100% of the forests
impacted by our operations over the year. Through direct Epic
Promise grants and contributions from our $1 guest donation
program, we partner with several local environmental organizations
to fund restoration projects, including the National Forest
Foundation, The Tahoe Fund, Grand Teton National Park Foundation,
Mountain Trails Foundation in Park City and the EnviroFund at
Whistler Blackcomb. We also encourage our employees to help protect
the environment and support their local community by volunteering
with various organizations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">For
Fiscal 2021, our focus for the EpicPromise community impact grant
program was on COVID-19 response in our resort communities,
including housing assistance, food security, equal access to
education and other basic needs and services. In addition, we
hosted more than 3,000 youth across our resorts through multi-day
programs focused on mentorship, leadership and the impact of
outdoor time on mental health in this unprecedented time. Finally,
our EpicPromise Employee Foundation (the “Foundation”), which was
established in 2015, is a charitable foundation funded by annual
contributions from the Company, its employees and its guests. The
Foundation supports Vail Resorts’ employees and their families via
grants for emergency relief and scholarships. Annually more than $1
million in grants and scholarships are provided to help employees
in times of need or to pursue educational opportunities. For more

stewardship, visit www.EpicPromise.com. Information on our websites

Vail Resorts, our Talent Philosophy focuses on fully achieving our
mission and vision by ensuring we have the talent in place to
deliver on our future growth plans. We are truly passionate about
our people, and we are focused on hiring and developing the best
talent and building the best teams around them. At fiscal year end,
we employed approximately 6,100 year-round employees. Over the
course of our Resorts’ various winter and summer operating seasons
in Fiscal 2021, we employed approximately 40,200 seasonal
employees. In addition, we employed approximately 100 year-round
employees and 100 seasonal employees on behalf of the owners of our
managed hotel properties. We consider our employee relations to be
positive.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
talent philosophy recognizes that people are our most important
asset in driving our business growth, and outlines the role that
leaders play in attracting, developing, engaging and rewarding high
performing, high potential talent, including supporting them to
achieve their future career growth. Our talent management system
enables leaders with programs and tools to effectively assess,
develop and reward talent and includes regular Leadership Talent
Review and Assessment processes to ensure that the caliber and
capability of our talent aligns with the sophistication of our
business strategies and processes. Our executive team reviews
talent strategy and succession planning frequently, including with
our Board of Directors, to assess current and future talent needs.
We have a strong track record of hiring, developing and preparing
high performing, high potential talent for internal mobility and
succession and since 2018, we have nearly doubled our percentage of
high performing, high potential talent through performance
management and talent upgrades. As a result, succession for our
senior leadership roles, is primarily sourced through internal
talent development and promotion, rather than external hires (72%
internal fill rate). Over the past twelve months, we announced
internal successors for some of the most senior roles in our
Company, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Marketing
Officer, President of the Mountain Division, and Chief Operating
Officer of Hospitality and Retail. All of our recent appointments
of General Manager and Chief Operating Officers of our Resorts for
the past three years came from internal succession.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">To
ensure we are building high performing teams, we encourage every
employee at every level within the Company to continuously grow
their leadership by participating in on-going leadership events
that build leadership capability and drive aligned leadership
expectations to enable business outcomes. We host an annual
Leadership Summit that brings together our leaders at manager level

employees of all levels to learn and grow as leaders and reward
this as part of our performance management process. The Lift, our
learning management system, gives employees access to a library of
online learning resources to help them succeed. We also provide
access to development tools, like the Insights Discovery platform,
a behavioral assessment that offers a framework for
self-understanding and development. Finally, to help employees
navigate unique challenges presented by COVID-19, we intentionally
invested in building new scalable digital programs to provide

response actions on employees, in order to make timely adjustments
to maintain strong alignment and focus, and to care for the needs

believe that diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) is core to
both our company success and the future growth of our industry. At
Vail Resorts, one of our core values is “Be Inclusive”, which means
that we expect everyone at our Company to be welcoming to others,
including all races, gender identities, sexual orientations,
abilities and other differences.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
have a long history of building gender diversity throughout the
Company. Women represent 48% of our corporate senior leaders at the
director level and above and over 50% of our corporate roles
generally. Ten resorts in our portfolio are led by women, including
three of our five largest resorts (Vail, Beaver Creek and
Breckenridge). As of November 1, 2021, five of our ten directors
will be women and two of our nine executive committee members are
women, and our Chief Executive Officer, Kirsten Lynch, will be the
only woman to head a Fortune 1000 company in travel and leisure.
While women currently represent only approximately 20% of mountain
operations senior leadership roles, we continue to strive to bring
more gender diversity to these roles, which have historically been
male-dominated. We have also developed Women in Leadership programs
to foster an inclusive culture, and Forbes named us one of
America’s Best Employers for Women in both 2019 and
2020.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We are
focused on improving racial diversity at Vail Resorts, as well as
in our communities and our industry. To that end, we are working
towards addressing barriers to attracting the best talent from
BIPOC communities in order to fuel innovation and growth within our
Company and industry. We are also incorporating more diverse
representation in our marketing efforts, including more direct
outreach to communities of color. Over this past year, we undertook
extensive efforts around DEI, including company-wide virtual
webinars bringing forward diverse voices, DEI dialogues with
external thought leaders, and online DEI training modules aligned
with our “Be Inclusive” value. As part of our commitment to driving
sustainable change, we are listening and learning as a company, and

of Whistler Blackcomb. The MDAs also provide for the granting of
specific tenures of land owned by the Province to the Whistler LP

land permanently reserved under the</span> <span class=

<span class="mtn20210731htm18">(Vic), with the exception of three

"mtn20210731htm89">Alpine Resorts (Management) Act 1997</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">(Vic) (the “ARM Act”), which is in
place to manage the development, promotion, management and use of
the resorts on a sustainable basis and in a manner that is
compatible with the alpine environment. The ARM Act established the
Alpine Resorts Commission to plan for the direction and sustainable
growth of Victoria’s five alpine resorts (including Falls Creek and
Hotham). This includes review and coordination of the
implementation of an Alpine Resorts Strategic Plan to which Falls
Creek and Hotham are subject.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
ARM Act also established each of the Falls Creek Resort Management
Board and Hotham Resort Management Board (the “RMBs”), each of
which is appointed by, and responsible to, the Minister for Energy,
Environment and Climate Change (the “Minister”). The RMBs are
responsible for the management and collection of fees for entrance
into the Alpine National Park and from Falls Creek and Hotham ski
resorts.&nbsp;The ARM Act authorizes the RMBs to grant leases
subject to Ministerial approval, and under this power, the entities
operating the Hotham and Falls Creek resorts have each been leased
land within the Alpine National Park under various long-term leases
with differing expiration dates. The main lease for the ski field
at Falls Creek expires December 31, 2040, while the main lease for
the ski field at Hotham expires December 31, 2057. The key ski
field leases provide for the payment of rent with both a fixed and
variable component, a community service charge payable to the ARCC
and a ski patrol contribution payable to RMBs. At Hotham, we also
lease land known as ‘Dinner Plain’ within the Alpine National Park
which expires on June 30, 2031, with an option to extend for a
further 10 years.</span></div>

significant negative impact on our financial condition and
operations. Further, the spread of COVID-19 has caused severe
disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and financial markets
and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues

outbreak and continuing spread of COVID-19 has disrupted our
business, and has had and could continue to have a significant
negative impact on our business, financial performance and

Governmental authorities have issued and continue to issue a
variety of mandates in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19,
including travel restrictions, border closures, restrictions on
public gatherings, occupancy limits, “shelter at home’’ orders and
advisories, and quarantine requirements. The outbreak of COVID-19
has impacted global economic activity and caused significant
volatility in financial markets, with particular risk to the travel
and leisure industry, which is disproportionately impacted by
travel restrictions and other public health
restrictions.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm133">In
response to the continued challenges associated with the spread of
COVID-19, we have had to close certain Resorts at various times.
For example, on March 30, 2021, towards the end of the North
American operating season and following an order from the
government of British Columbia as a result of an increase in
COVID-19 cases in the region, we closed Whistler Blackcomb. Our
other North American Resorts were generally operational throughout
the 2020/2021 ski season, after closing early in the 2019/2020
season, and were open for 2021 summer activities. Our Australian
Resorts were open for their 2021 winter season, however there were
border closures, travel restrictions and public health orders in
place throughout the country that impacted visitation to our
Australian ski areas and caused periodic Resort closures. We are
also monitoring public health orders and regulations that affect or
may affect our winter operations for the 2021/2022 North American
ski season.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
April 2020, the Company introduced Epic Coverage, which is included
with the purchase of all pass products for no additional charge.
Epic Coverage offers refunds to pass product holders if certain

express terms and conditions</span><span class=

"mtn20210731htm133">Accordingly, to the extent that any of our
Resorts need to be closed for all or specified portions of the ski
season (including due to COVID-19), we could be required to provide
a significant amount of refunds to our pass product holders,
subject to express terms and conditions, which could have a
material negative impact on our financial performance and

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
estimated amount of refunds reduce the amount of pass product
revenue recognized by the Company. To estimate the amount of
refunds under Epic Coverage, the Company considers (i) historical
claims data for personal events, (ii) provincial, state, county and
local COVID-19 regulations and public health orders, and (iii) the
Company’s operating plans for its Resorts. The Company believes the
estimates of refunds are reasonable; however, the program is
relatively new and there continues to be uncertainty surrounding
COVID-19, and therefore actual results could vary materially from
such estimates, and the Company could be required to refund
significantly higher amounts than estimated.</span></div>

travel.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
business is sensitive to the willingness of our guests to travel.
Acts of terrorism, pandemics, political events and developments in
military conflicts in areas of the world from which we draw our
guests could depress the public’s propensity to travel and cause
severe disruptions in both domestic and international air travel
and consumer discretionary spending, which could reduce the number
of visitors to our Resorts and have an adverse effect on our
results of operations. Many of our guests travel by air and the
impact of higher prices for commercial airline services,
availability of air services and willingness of guests to travel by
air could cause a decrease in visitation by Destination guests to
our Resorts. A significant portion of our guests also travel by
vehicle and higher gasoline prices or willingness of guests to
travel generally due to safety or traffic concerns could cause a
decrease in visitation by guests who would typically drive to our
Resorts. Higher cost of travel may also affect the amount that
guests are willing to spend at our Resorts and could negatively
impact our revenue particularly for lodging, ski school, dining and
retail/rental.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Additionally, our success depends on our ability
to attract visitors to our Resorts. Changes in consumer tastes and
preferences, particularly those affecting the popularity of skiing
and snowboarding, and other social and demographic trends could
adversely affect the number of skier visits during a ski season. A
significant decline in skier visits compared to historical levels
would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm117"><span class="mtn20210731htm77">We
are subject to the risk of prolonged weakness in general economic
conditions including adverse effects on the overall travel and
leisure related industries.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Skiing, travel and tourism are discretionary
recreational activities that can entail a relatively high cost of
participation and may be adversely affected by economic slowdown or
recession. Economic conditions in North America, Europe and parts
of the rest of the world, including high unemployment, erosion of
consumer confidence, sovereign debt issues and financial
instability in the global markets, could have negative effects on
the travel and leisure industry and on our results of operations.
See “Risks Related to Our Business—The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
has had, and could continue to have, a significant negative impact
on our financial condition and operations. Further, the spread of
COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global
economies and financial markets and could potentially create
widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown
magnitude and duration. Any future outbreak of any COVID-19
variants or other highly infectious or contagious disease could
have a similar impact.” As a result of these and other economic
uncertainties, we have experienced and may continue to experience
in the future, a change in booking trends including where guest
reservations are made much closer to the actual date of stay, a
decrease in the length of stay, a decrease in consumer spending
and/or a decrease in group bookings. We cannot predict what further
impact these uncertainties may continue to have on overall travel
and leisure or more specifically, on our guest visitation, guest
spending or other related trends and the ultimate impact it will
have on our results of operations. Additionally, the actual or
perceived fear of weakness in the economy could also lead to
decreased spending by our guests. This could be further exacerbated
by the fact that we charge some of the highest prices for single
day lift tickets and ancillary services in the ski industry;
however, we offer pass products, including the Epic Day Pass, that
are available at a discount to the single day lift ticket prices.
In the event of a decrease in visitation and overall guest spending
we may decide we need to offer a higher amount of discounts and
incentives than we have historically, which would adversely impact
our operating results. Our Resorts also serve as a destination for
international guests. To the extent there are material changes in
exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar or travel restrictions
in place due to COVID-19, it could impact the volume of
international visitation, which could have a significant impact on
our operating results.</span></div>

are vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions and the impact of
natural disasters.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
ability to attract guests to our Resorts is influenced by weather
conditions and by the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski
season. Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier
visits and our revenue and profits. Unseasonably warm weather may
result in inadequate natural snowfall and reduce skiable terrain,
which increases the cost of snowmaking and could render snowmaking,
wholly or partially, ineffective in maintaining quality skiing
conditions, including in areas which are not accessible by
snowmaking equipment. On the other hand, excessive natural snowfall
may significantly increase the costs incurred to groom trails and
may make it difficult for guests to access our mountain
Resorts.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">There
can be no assurance that our Resorts will receive seasonal
snowfalls near their historical averages. As an example of weather
variability, during the 2017/2018 North American ski season, we
experienced historically low snowfall across our western U.S.
Resorts for the first half of the ski season, with snowfall in
Vail, Beaver Creek and Park City through January 31, 2018 at the
lowest levels recorded in over 30 years while Tahoe was more than
50% below the 20-year average. Conversely, during the 2018/2019
North American ski season, our western U.S. Resorts experienced

over 30 years. During the 2020/2021 North American ski season,
snowfall levels were well below average at our Colorado, Utah and
Tahoe Resorts through the holiday season. Past snowfall levels or
consistency of snow conditions can impact sales of pass products or
other advanced bookings. Additionally, the early season snow
conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions
can influence the momentum and success of the overall ski season.
Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect our Resorts and
lodging properties as guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if
conditions differ from those that are typical at such Resorts for a
given season. Although we have created geographic diversification
to help mitigate the impact of weather variability, there is no way
for us to predict future weather patterns or the impact that
weather patterns may have on our results of operations or
visitation.</span></div>

visit our Resorts in affected areas and negatively impact our
revenue and profitability. Damage to our properties could take a
long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have
adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair and recoup lost
profits. Furthermore, such a disaster may interrupt or impede
access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may
cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an
indefinite period. The ability to attract visitors to our Resorts
is also influenced by the aesthetics and natural beauty of the
outdoor environment where our Resorts are located. A severe forest
fire or other severe impacts from naturally occurring events could
negatively impact the natural beauty of our Resorts and have a
long-term negative impact on our overall guest visitation as it

business is highly seasonal.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
mountain and lodging operations are highly seasonal in nature. Peak
operating season for our North American Resorts is from late
November to mid-April, and accordingly, revenue and profits from
our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially
lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late
fall. Conversely, peak operating seasons for our Australian
Resorts, GTLC and Flagg Ranch, mountain summer activities
(including our Epic Discovery program), sightseeing and our golf
courses generally occur from June to the end of September. Revenue
and profits generated by our Australian Resorts, GTLC and Flagg
Ranch, mountain summer activities/sightseeing and golf peak season
operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off-season
losses from our other mountain and lodging operations. For Fiscal
2021, approximately 82% of total combined Mountain and Lodging
segment net revenue (excluding Lodging segment revenue associated
with reimbursement of payroll costs) was earned during our second
and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality is partially mitigated
by the sale of pass products (which for Fiscal 2021 accounted for
approximately 61% of the total lift revenue) predominately
occurring during the period prior to the start of the ski season as
the cash from those sales is collected in advance and revenue is
mostly recognized in the second and third quarters. In addition,
the timing of major holidays and school breaks can impact vacation
patterns and therefore visitation at our destination mountain
Resorts and regional ski areas. If we were to experience an adverse
event or realize a significant deterioration in our operating
results during our peak periods (our fiscal second and third
quarters) we would be unable to fully recover any significant
declines due to the seasonality of our business (for example, the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in Resort
closures). See “Risks Related to Our Business—The ongoing COVID-19
pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a significant
negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Further,
the spread of COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S.
and global economies and financial markets and could potentially
create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown
magnitude and duration. Any future outbreak of any COVID-19 variant
or other highly infectious or contagious disease could have a
similar impact.”. Operating results for any three-month period are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for

our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and

long-term growth and profitability depend partially on our ability
to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage
our Resorts. Adequate staffing and retention of qualified employees
is a critical factor affecting our guests’ experiences in our
Resorts. Maintaining adequate staffing requires precise workforce
planning which has been complicated and is unpredictable due the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on guest preferences and on labor
markets. The market for the most qualified talent continues to be
competitive and we must provide competitive wages, benefits and
workplace conditions to attract and retain our most qualified
employees. Year round employees may seek other employment and
seasonal employees may decline to return, to be re-hired, or to be
hired for the first time. Personal or public health concerns
related to COVID-19 might make some employees and potential
candidates reluctant to work in enclosed environments such as our
hotels, restaurants and retail/rental stores. Resort-area housing
could be even more limited than usual, making it difficult for
employees to obtain available, affordable housing.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
mountain and lodging operations are highly dependent on a large
seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of
seasonal staffing needs each season and work to manage seasonal
wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the
appropriate workforce is in place. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal
personnel as the business requires. Changes in immigration laws
could also impact our workforce because we recruit and hire foreign
nationals as part of our seasonal workforce. For example, as a
result of a 2020 executive order in the United States suspending
the issuance of several visas for foreign workers, we were unable
to hire foreign nationals for the 2020/2021 North America ski
season. A shortage of international workers based on immigration

matters such as minimum wage requirements, sick leave pay, overtime
compensation and other working conditions, work authorization
requirements, discrimination and family and medical leave. Cost of
labor and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost
of our operations. Labor shortages, affordable employee housing
shortages and increased employee turnover and health care mandates
could also increase our labor costs and labor-related benefits. As
minimum wage rates increase, including further potential federal
and state legislative changes to the minimum wage rate, we may need
to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but
also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above the
minimum wage. During Fiscal 2021, we announced a substantial
investment in our employees by increasing the minimum wage to $15
at our Resorts across Colorado, California, Utah, Washington, New
York and Vermont, as well as other increases at our Resorts in the
eastern U.S. From time to time, we have also experienced non-union
employees attempting to unionize. While only a very small portion
of our employees are unionized at present, we may experience
additional union activity in the future, which could lead to
disruptions in our business, increases in our operating costs
and/or constraints on our operating flexibility. These potential
labor impacts could adversely impact our results of

opportunity for redress or correction. Our ability to attract and
retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of
the Company, the quality and safety of our Resorts, services and
activities, including summer activities, and our corporate and
management integrity. While we maintain and promote an on-mountain
safety program, there are inherent risks associated with our Resort
activities. From time to time in the past, accidents and other
injuries have occurred on Resort property. An accident or an injury
at any of our Resorts or at resorts operated by competitors,
particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests
and employees that receives media attention, could negatively
impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence
in us, reduce visitation at our Resorts, and negatively impact our

our brands declines, our market share, reputation, business,
financial condition or results of operations could be adversely
impacted. Additionally, our intellectual property, including our
trademarks, domain names and other proprietary rights, constitutes
a significant part of our value. Any misappropriation, infringement

the amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will
depend upon a number of factors, including our available cash on
hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition,
restrictions contained in our Eighth Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the “Vail Holdings Credit Agreement”), any future
contractual restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash
flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of
Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors may also suspend the
payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. For
example, on April 1, 2020, in response to actions taken in response
to COVID-19, we announced that our Board of Directors suspended our
quarterly dividend for at least two quarters, which such suspension
continued throughout Fiscal 2021. Additionally, during the period
that we are subject to the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver
Period (See “Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure—Restrictions
imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may prevent or limit our
future business plans.”), we are prohibited from paying any
dividends or making share repurchases, unless (x) no default or
potential default exists under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement
and (y) we have liquidity of at least $300.0 million, and the
aggregate amount of dividends paid and share repurchases made by us
during the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver Period may not
exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal quarter. If we do not pay
dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for
investors to realize a gain on their investment in Vail Resorts,
Inc. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact
depreciate in value. On September 22, 2021, our Board of Directors
approved a cash dividend of $0.88 per share payable on October 22,
2021 to stockholders of record as of October 5, 2021. Additionally,
a Canadian dollar equivalent dividend on the Exchangeco Shares will
be payable on October 22, 2021 to the shareholders of record as of
October 5, 2021. We expect to fund the dividend with available cash
on hand and will do so pursuant to the restrictions under the

common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)

shares of common stock were outstanding, held by approximately 258
holders of record.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm101">Dividend Policy</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors approved the commencement of a
regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to
quarterly declaration, which has typically been increased on an
annual basis. We announced on April 1, 2020 that we would be
suspending the declaration of our quarterly dividend in response to
the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which such suspension has
continued throughout the year ended July 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”).
Additionally, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the Vail Holdings
Credit Agreement (as defined below), we are prohibited from paying
any dividends during the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver
Period (as defined below) unless (x) no default or potential
default exists under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and (y) the
Company has liquidity (as defined below) of at least $300.0
million, and the aggregate amount of dividends paid and share
repurchases made by the Company during the Financial Covenants
Temporary Waiver Period may not exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal
quarter. The amount, if any, of dividends to be paid in the future
will depend on our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs,
overall financial condition, restrictions contained in our Vail
Holdings Credit Agreement, future prospects for earnings and cash
flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of
Directors. On September 22, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a
cash dividend of $0.88 per share payable on October 22, 2021 to
stockholders of record as of October 5, 2021. Additionally, a
Canadian dollar equivalent dividend on the Exchangeco Shares will
be payable on October 22, 2021 to the shareholders of record as of
October 5, 2021. We expect to fund the dividend with available cash
on hand and will do so pursuant to the restrictions under the
Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver Period.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021. The share repurchase program is
conducted under authorizations made from time to time by our Board
of Directors. On March&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the
Company to repurchase up to 3,000,000&nbsp;shares of common stock.
On July&nbsp;16, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors increased
the authorization by an additional&nbsp;3,000,000&nbsp;shares, and
on December 4, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the
authorization by an additional&nbsp;1,500,000&nbsp;shares for a
total authorization to repurchase shares of up
to&nbsp;7,500,000&nbsp;shares. Since inception of this stock
repurchase program through July&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company has
repurchased 6,161,141 shares at a cost of approximately $404.4
million. As of July&nbsp;31, 2021, 1,338,859 shares remained
available to repurchase under the existing repurchase
authorization. Repurchases under these authorizations may be made
from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable
laws, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The
timing as well as the number of Vail Shares that may be repurchased
under the program will depend on several factors, including our
future financial performance, our available cash resources and
competing uses for cash that may arise in the future, the
restrictions in our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, prevailing
prices of Vail Shares and the number of Vail Shares that become
available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive. These
authorizations have no expiration date.</span></div>

MD&amp;A includes discussion of financial performance within each
of our three segments. We have chosen to specifically include
segment Reported EBITDA (defined as segment net revenue less
segment operating expense, plus or minus segment equity investment
income or loss and for the Real Estate segment, plus gain or loss
on sale of real property) in the following discussion because we
consider this measurement to be a significant indication of our
financial performance. We utilize segment Reported EBITDA in
evaluating our performance and in allocating resources to our
segments. Net Debt (defined as long-term debt, net plus long-term
debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents) is
included in the following discussion because we consider this
measurement to be a significant indication of our available capital
resources. We also believe that Net Debt is an important
measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain
additional capital resources for our future cash needs. Resort
Reported EBITDA (defined as the combination of segment Reported
EBITDA of our Mountain and Lodging segments), Total Reported EBITDA
(which is Resort Reported EBITDA plus segment Reported EBITDA from
our Real Estate segment) and Net Debt are not measures of financial
performance or liquidity defined under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Refer to the end

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Additionally, we operate ancillary services,
including ski school, dining and retail/rental operations, and for
our Australian ski areas, including lodging and transportation
operations. Mountain segment revenue is seasonal, with the majority
of revenue earned from our North American destination mountain
resorts and regional ski areas (collectively, our “Resorts”)
occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters and the majority
of revenue earned from our Australian ski areas occurring in our
first and fourth fiscal quarters. Our North American Resorts are
typically open for business from mid-November through mid-April,
which is the peak operating season for the Mountain segment, and
our Australian ski areas are typically open for business from June
to early October. Our single largest source of Mountain segment
revenue is the sale of lift tickets (including pass products),
which represented approximately 64%, 53% and 53% of Mountain
segment net revenue for Fiscal 2021, the fiscal year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”) and the fiscal year ended

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Lift
revenue is driven by volume and pricing. Pricing is impacted by
both absolute pricing, as well as the demographic mix of guests,
which impacts the price points at which various products are
purchased. The demographic mix of guests that visit our North
American mountain resorts is divided into two primary categories:
(1) out-of-state and international (“Destination”) guests and (2)
in-state and local (“Local”) guests. For the 2020/2021 North
American ski season, Destination guests comprised approximately 52%
of our North American destination mountain resort skier visits
(excluding complimentary access), while Local guests comprised
approximately 48%, which compares to approximately 58% and 42%,
respectively, for the 2019/2020 North American ski season and
approximately 57% and 43%, respectively, for the 2018/2019 North
American ski season. Skier visitation at our regional ski areas is
largely comprised of Local guests. Destination guests generally
purchase our higher-priced lift tickets (including pass products)
and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school, dining and
retail/rental, as well as lodging at or around our mountain
resorts. The impacts of COVID-19, including travel restrictions,
had a disproportionately adverse impact on Destination visitation,
particularly international guests, as demand for long-distance
travel was lower than normal throughout the 2020/2021 North
American ski season. Additionally, Destination guest visitation is
less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather during the
current ski season, but may be more impacted by adverse economic
conditions, the global geopolitical climate or weather conditions
in the immediately preceding ski season. Local guests tend to be
more value-oriented and weather sensitive.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
offer a variety of pass products for all of our Resorts marketed
towards both Destination and Local guests. Our pass product
offerings range from providing access to one or a combination of
our Resorts for a certain number of days to our Epic Pass, which
allows pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all of our
Resorts. The Epic Day Pass is a customizable one to seven day pass
product purchased in advance of the season, for those skiers and
riders who expect to ski a certain number of days during the
season, and which is available in two tiers of resort access
offerings. For the 2021/2022 North American ski season, we reduced
prices of our entire portfolio of pass products by 20%. Our pass
program provides a compelling value proposition to our guests,
which in turn assists us in developing a loyal base of customers
who commit to ski at our Resorts generally in advance of the ski
season and typically ski more days each season at our Resorts than
those guests who do not buy pass products. Additionally, we have
entered into strategic long-term season pass alliance agreements
with third-party mountain resorts including Telluride Ski Resort in
Colorado, Sun Valley Resort in Idaho, Snowbasin Resort in Utah,
Hakuba Valley and Rusutsu Resort in Japan, Resorts of the Canadian
Rockies in Canada, Les 3 Vallées in France, 4 Vallées in
Switzerland, Skirama Dolomiti in Italy and Ski Arlberg in Austria,
which further increases the value proposition of our pass products.
As such, our pass program drives strong customer loyalty, mitigates
exposure to more weather sensitive guests, generates additional
ancillary spending and provides cash flow in advance of winter
season operations. In addition, our pass program attracts new
guests to our Resorts. All of our pass products, including the Epic
Pass and Epic Day Pass, are predominately sold prior to the start
of the ski season. Pass product revenue, although primarily
collected prior to the ski season, is recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations throughout the ski season
primarily based on historical visitation (excluding visitation data
for Fiscal 2020, which we do not believe is indicative of future
visitation due to the early resort closures associated with
COVID-19 in March 2020).</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Lift
revenue consists of pass product lift revenue (“pass revenue”) and
non-pass product lift revenue (“non-pass revenue”). Approximately
61%, 51% and 47% of total lift revenue was derived from pass
revenue for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively
(including the impact of the deferral of pass product revenue from
Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2021 as a result of the Credit Offer, as
defined below). Additionally, lift revenue for Fiscal 2021 was
impacted by the Company only allowing pass product holders to
access the Resorts during the early portion of the 2020/2021 North
American ski season, as well as the Company utilizing a reservation
system, which limited capacity for both pass product holders and
non-pass lift tickets.</span></div>

properties represented approximately 64%, 73% and 70% of Lodging
segment net revenue (excluding Lodging segment revenue associated
with reimbursement of payroll costs) for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020
and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Management primarily focuses on
Lodging net revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements and
Lodging operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs (which
are not measures of financial performance under GAAP) as the
reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added
margin; as such, the revenue and corresponding expense have no
effect on our Lodging Reported EBITDA, which we use to evaluate
Lodging segment performance. Revenue of the Lodging segment during
our first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the
operations of our NPS concessionaire properties (as their operating
season generally occurs from June to the end of September);
mountain resort golf operations and seasonally lower volume from
our other owned and managed properties and businesses.</span></div>

applicable permits. We continue undertaking preliminary planning
and design work on future projects and are pursuing opportunities
with third-party developers rather than undertaking our own
significant vertical development projects. Additionally, real
estate development projects by third-party developers most often
result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide
additional benefit to the Mountain segment. We believe that, due to
our low carrying cost of real estate land investments, we are well
situated to promote future projects by third-party developers while
limiting our financial risk. Our revenue from the Real Estate
segment and associated expense can fluctuate significantly based
upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold,
causing volatility in the Real Estate segment’s operating results

rates and volatility in global and local economies.&nbsp;Our

challenges in North America or declining or slowing growth in
economies outside of North America, accompanied by devaluation of
currencies, rising inflation, trade tariffs and lower commodity
prices. We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the global
economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 will have on overall
travel and leisure spending or more specifically, on our guest
visitation, guest spending or other related trends for the upcoming
2021/2022 North American ski season.</span></div>

prior year, we announced the early closure of the 2019/2020 North
American ski season for our Resorts, lodging properties and retail
stores beginning on March 15, 2020. These actions (the “Resort
Closures”) had a significant adverse impact on our results of
operations for the year ended July 31, 2020. Additionally, on April
27, 2020, we announced that we would offer credits to customers who
had purchased 2019/2020 North American pass products and who
purchased 2020/2021 North American pass products on or before
September 17, 2020 (the “Credit Offer”). The Credit Offer discounts
ranged from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 80% for season pass
holders, depending on the number of days the pass holder used their
pass product during the 2019/2020 season and a credit, with no
minimum, but up to 80% for multi-day pass products, such as the
Epic Day Pass, based on total unused days. As a result of the
Credit Offer to 2019/2020 pass product holders, we delayed the
recognition of approximately $120.9 million of season pass deferred
revenue, as well as approximately $2.9 million of related deferred
costs, that would have been recognized in Fiscal 2020 and which was
instead primarily recognized in the second and third quarters of
Fiscal 2021.</span></div>

ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced
visitation and decreased spending for the 2020/2021 North American
ski season compared to the prior year through March 14, 2021, the
equivalent date that we closed our Resorts early for the 2019/2020
North American ski season due to the outbreak of COVID-19. These
declines were primarily driven by reduced demand for Destination
visitation at our western resorts and COVID-19 related capacity
limitations, which were further impacted by snowfall levels that
were well below average at our Colorado, Utah and Tahoe resorts
from the early season throughout the holiday season. Visitation and

restrictions were in place, including Whistler Blackcomb, Tahoe and
Vermont. However, results continued to improve as the season
progressed, primarily as a result of stronger Destination
visitation at our Colorado and Utah resorts, including improved
lift ticket purchases. Whistler Blackcomb’s results were
disproportionately impacted as compared to our broader Mountain
segment as a result of the Canadian travel restrictions and border
closures, and were further impacted by the early closure of
Whistler Blackcomb on March 30, 2021 following a provincial health
order issued by the government of British Columbia due to an
increase in COVID-19 cases in the region. Our Fiscal 2021 first
quarter results were negatively impacted by Mount Hotham and Falls
Creek, which opened for the 2020 Australian ski season on July 6,
2020, but we decided to close them four days later due to a “stay
at home” order put in place by the Victorian government and
specifically for the Melbourne metropolitan area, which represents
the majority of visitors for Mount Hotham and Falls Creek, as a
result of a reemergence of COVID-19 in the region. Additionally,
our Australian ski areas were also impacted by “stay at home”
orders and periodic resort closures during the 2021 ski season,
which had a negative impact on our Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter
results. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 also resulted in reduced
occupancy at our lodging properties during the 2019/2020 North
American ski season following our early closure in March 2020, as
well as during the 2020/2021 North American ski season. We closed
our GTLC facilities including Jackson Lake Lodge and Jenny Lake
Lodge during the summer of 2020, implemented restrictions on guided
activities and in-restaurant dining, and temporarily closed many
other facilities, which negatively impacted results for the first
quarter of Fiscal 2021. These actions, trends, and the COVID-19
pandemic in general, had a significant adverse impact on our
results of operations for the Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, and may
continue to have a material, negative impact on our resorts and
lodging properties for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2022
(“Fiscal 2022”).</span></div>

timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on Mountain and
Lodging revenue, particularly with regard to skier visits and the
duration and frequency of guest visitation. To help mitigate this
impact, we sell a variety of pass products prior to the beginning
of the ski season which results in a more stabilized stream of lift
revenue. In March 2021, we began our pass product sales program for
the 2021/2022 North American ski season, which included a 20%
reduction in price for all pass products. Pass product sales
through September 17, 2021 for the upcoming 2021/2022 North
American ski season increased approximately 42% in units and
approximately 17% in sales dollars as compared to the period in the
prior year through September 18, 2020, without deducting for the
value of any redeemed credits provided to certain North American
pass product holders in the prior period. To provide a comparison
to the season pass results released on June 7, 2021, pass product
sales through September 17, 2021 increased approximately 67% in
units and approximately 45% in sales dollars as compared to the
period through September 20, 2019, with pass product sales adjusted
to include Peak Resorts pass sales in both periods. Pass product
sales are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by
applying an exchange rate of $0.79 between the Canadian dollar and
U.S. dollar in all periods for Whistler Blackcomb. We cannot
predict if this favorable trend will continue through the fall 2021
North American pass sales campaign or the overall impact that pass
sales will have on lift revenue for the 2021/2022 North American
ski season.</span></div>

the 2020/2021 North American ski season, we introduced Epic
Coverage, which is included with the purchase of all pass products
for no additional charge. Epic Coverage provides refunds in the
event of certain resort closures and certain qualifying travel
restrictions (e.g. for COVID-19), giving pass product holders a
refund for any portion of the season that is lost due to qualifying
circumstances. Additionally, Epic Coverage provides a refund for
qualifying personal circumstances that were historically covered by
our pass insurance program, including for eligible injuries, job
losses and many other personal events. The estimated amount of
refunds reduces the amount of pass product revenue recognized. We
believe our estimate of refund amounts are reasonable; however,
actual results could vary materially from such estimates, and we
could be required to refund significantly higher amounts than
estimated.</span></div>

food and beverage, lodging, group ski school lessons, equipment
rentals and more at our North American owned and operated Resorts.
Epic Mountain Rewards constitutes an option to our guests to
purchase additional products and services from us at a discount and

Resort Closures, including the deferral of $120.9&nbsp;million of
pass product revenue from Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2021 as a result of
the Credit Offer to 2019/2020 North American pass product holders,
as well as cost discipline efforts in the current year associated
with lower levels of operations. These increases were partially
offset by limitations and restrictions on our North American winter
operations and closures, limitations and restrictions at Perisher,
Falls Creek and Hotham during both the 2020 and 2021 Australian ski
seasons. Additionally, Whistler Blackcomb’s performance was
negatively impacted in the current year due to the continued
closure of the Canadian border to international guests and was
further impacted by the resort closing earlier than expected on
March 30, 2021 following a provincial health order issued by the
government of British Columbia. Mountain segment results also
include $1.0 million and $13.6&nbsp;million of acquisition and
integration related expenses for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020,
respectively, which are recorded within Mountain other operating
expense. Additionally, operating results from Whistler Blackcomb,
which are translated from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars, were
favorably affected by increases in the Canadian dollar exchange
rate relative to the U.S. dollar as compared to the prior year,
resulting in an increase in Mountain Reported EBITDA of

the Credit Offer from Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2021, partially offset

school revenue, dining revenue and retail/rental revenue in Fiscal
2020 all decreased compared to Fiscal 2019 due to the Resort
Closures. These decreases were partially offset by incremental
revenue from our acquisitions of Peak Resorts, Falls Creek and
Hotham of $18.0 million of ski school revenue, $23.8 million of
dining revenue and $26.8&nbsp;million of retail/rental
revenue.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Other
revenue mainly consists of summer visitation and mountain
activities revenue, employee housing revenue, guest services
revenue, commercial leasing revenue, marketing and internet
advertising revenue, private club revenue (which includes both club
dues and amortization of initiation fees), municipal services
revenue and other recreation activity revenue. Other revenue is
also comprised of Australian ski area lodging and transportation
revenue. For Fiscal 2020, other revenue decreased as a result of
the Resort Closures, partially offset by incremental revenue from
Peak Resorts of approximately $12.6 million.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Resort
Closures and the associated actions taken by the Company to reduce
costs resulted in a decrease in our operating expense of $67.5
million, or 5.3%, which includes incremental operating expenses
from Peak Resorts, Falls Creek and Hotham of approximately $121.4
million, as well as $13.6 million and $16.4 million of acquisition
and integration related expenses for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019,

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Labor
and labor-related benefits decreased 6.8%, which primarily resulted
from cost actions associated with the Resort Closures, including
decreased staffing, employee furloughs, salary reductions and
reduced variable compensation accruals, as well as tax credits of
approximately $12.0 million associated with COVID-19 related
legislation passed in the U.S., Canada and Australia, partially
offset by incremental expenses from Peak Resorts, Falls Creek and
Hotham of approximately $50.7 million. Retail cost of sales
decreased 20.5% compared to a decrease in retail sales of 20.1%.
Resort related fees decreased 22.0% primarily due to decreases in
revenue on which those fees are based, partially offset by
incremental expenses from Peak Resorts of approximately $4.3
million. General and administrative expense increased 2.7%
primarily due to incremental expenses from Peak Resorts, Falls
Creek and Hotham of approximately $18.9 million, partially offset
by a decrease in allocated corporate overhead costs, a decrease in
variable compensation accruals primarily as a result of the Resort
Closures and tax credits of approximately $3.3 million associated
with COVID-19 related legislation passed in the U.S., Canada and
Australia. Other expense increased 2.1% primarily due to
incremental operating expenses from Peak Resorts, Falls Creek and
Hotham of approximately $42.2 million, partially offset by
decreases in variable operating expenses associated with the Resort
Closures, as well as a decrease in acquisition and integration
related expenses.</span></div>

closed on two land sales during the third quarter of Fiscal 2019
with third party developers at Keystone (One River Run site) and
Breckenridge (East Peak 8 site) for proceeds of approximately
$16.0&nbsp;million, including $4.8&nbsp;million associated with the
sale of density for the Breckenridge property. The land parcel
sales were accounted for as financing arrangements as a result of
the Company’s continuing involvement with the underlying assets
that were sold, including but not limited to, the obligation to
repurchase finished commercial space from the development projects
upon completion. As a result, the estimated gain of
$3.6&nbsp;million associated with the East Peak 8 site and the
estimated loss of $3.2&nbsp;million associated with the One River
Run site will be deferred until the Company no longer maintains
continuing involvement. Additionally, the Company’s future
obligation to repurchase finished commercial space in the two
completed projects, as well as other related capital spending, will
result in total estimated capital expenditures of up to
approximately $9.5&nbsp;million in future fiscal
years.</span></div>

of non-cash interest expense associated with amortization of the

unsecured bond offering which was completed on May 4, 2020;
incremental term loan borrowings under the Vail Holdings Credit
Agreement of $335.6 million, which were used to fund the Peak
Resorts acquisition in September 2019; and incremental borrowings
under the revolver components of our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement
and Whistler Credit Agreement, which were almost entirely drawn on
during Fiscal 2020 as a precautionary measure in order to increase
our cash position and financial flexibility in light of the
financial market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic

intercompany loan, which had an outstanding balance of

The decrease in the effective tax rate provision during Fiscal 2021

excess tax benefits from employee share awards that were exercised
(stock appreciation rights) and that vested (restricted stock
awards). The decrease in the effective tax rate during Fiscal 2020
compared to Fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower full year
pre-tax net income, as well as a one-time, provisional $3.8 million
benefit related to the net operating loss carryback provision of
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, partially
offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits from employee share

seasonality of our Mountain segment operations, although our
available cash balances as of July&nbsp;31, 2021 and 2020 were

generated $525.3 million of cash from operating activities during
Fiscal 2021, an increase of $130.3 million when compared to $395.0
million of cash generated during Fiscal 2020. The increase in
operating cash flows was primarily a result of (i) an increase in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities (excluding accounts
payable and accrued liabilities assumed through acquisitions)
primarily due to an increase in accrued trade payables, salaries
and wages in the current year due to a return to more normal
operations, as compared to significantly lower accruals in the
prior year due to the Resort Closures; (ii) an increase in pass
product sales and collections as compared to the prior year,
primarily as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, including the
extended pass product sales deadline in the prior year and the
impact of the Credit Offer; and (iii) a decrease in inventories
(excluding inventories assumed through acquisitions) as of July 31,
2021 as compared to the beginning of the fiscal year relative to an
increase in the prior year period. These increases were partially
offset by an increase in cash interest payments of $37.3 million in
Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to
incremental cash interest payments on the 6.25% Notes issued in May
2020, for which the first interest payments were made during Fiscal
2021.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Cash
used in investing activities for Fiscal 2021 decreased by $389.4
million, primarily due to cash payments of $327.6 million, net of
cash acquired, related to the acquisition of Peak Resorts during
Fiscal 2020. Additionally, capital expenditures decreased by $57.2
million primarily as a result of the deferral of a significant
amount of discretionary capital projects related to the Company’s
decision during the outbreak of COVID-19 to prioritize near-term
liquidity.</span></div>

$212.7&nbsp;million; (iii) a decrease in net payments of $208.0
million under the revolver component of our Vail Holdings Credit
Agreement; and (iv) a decrease in repurchases of common stock of
$46.4 million. These increases were partially offset by (i)
proceeds of $600.0 million related to the issuance of our 6.25%
Notes during Fiscal 2020; (ii) proceeds of $335.6 million from
incremental borrowings under the term loan portion of our Vail
Holdings Credit Agreement during Fiscal 2020, which were used to
fund the Peak Resorts acquisition; (iii) an increase in net
payments under the revolver component of our Whistler Credit

result of decreased Mountain and Lodging segment operating results
in Fiscal 2020, primarily due to the Resort Closures; a decrease in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to declines associated
with the Resort Closures (excluding accounts payable and accrued
liabilities assumed through acquisitions) and an increase in cash
interest payments of approximately $17.5 million primarily
associated with debt assumed in the Peak Resorts acquisition and
incremental term loan and revolver borrowings under our Vail
Holdings Credit Agreement. These decreases were partially offset by
increased North American pass product sales and receivable
collections for the 2019/2020 North American ski season as compared
to the prior year and a decrease in estimated tax payments of $23.1
million. Additionally we generated approximately $4.4 million of

of $38.6 million; and (v) a decrease in dividend payments of $47.8

$1,244.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of July&nbsp;31,
2021, compared to $391.0 million as of July&nbsp;31, 2020. Although
we cannot predict the future impact associated with the COVID-19
pandemic on our business, we currently anticipate that our Mountain
and Lodging segment operating results will continue to provide a
significant source of future operating cash flows (primarily
generated in our second and third fiscal quarters).</span></div>

addition to our $1,244.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at
July&nbsp;31, 2021, we had $417.7 million available under the
revolver component of our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement as of
July&nbsp;31, 2021 (which represents the total commitment of
$500.0&nbsp;million less certain letters of credit outstanding of
$82.3 million).&nbsp;Also, to further support the liquidity needs
of Whistler Blackcomb, we had C$243.1 million ($194.9 million)
available under the revolver component of our Whistler Credit
Agreement (which represents the total commitment of C$300.0 million
($240.5 million) less outstanding borrowings of C$56.0&nbsp;million
($44.9 million) and a letter of credit outstanding of C$0.9 million
($0.7 million)). We expect that our liquidity needs in the near
term will be met by continued use of our existing cash and cash
equivalents, operating cash flows and borrowings under both the
Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and Whistler Credit Agreement, if
needed. The Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and the Whistler Credit
Agreement provide adequate flexibility and are priced favorably
with any new borrowings currently priced at LIBOR plus 2.5% and

expenditures for our resort operations, and we expect to continue
to do so, subject to operating performance particularly as it
relates to discretionary projects. In addition, we may incur
capital expenditures for retained ownership interests associated
with third-party real estate development projects. Currently
planned capital expenditures primarily include investments that
will allow us to maintain our high-quality standards, as well as
certain incremental discretionary improvements at our Resorts,
throughout our owned hotels and in technology that can impact the
full network.&nbsp;We evaluate additional discretionary capital
improvements based on an expected level of return on

$120 million on resort capital expenditures during calendar year
2021, excluding one-time items associated with integrations of $5
million and $12 million of reimbursable investments, as well as
real estate related capital. Including these one-time items, we
expect that our total capital plan will be approximately $135
million to $140 million. Included in these estimated capital
expenditures are approximately $75 million to $80 million of
maintenance capital expenditures, which are necessary to maintain
appearance and level of service appropriate to our resort
operations. Discretionary expenditures expected for calendar year
2021 include, among other projects, several investments which were
previously deferred from calendar year 2020 as a result of
COVID-19, including the 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in
the McCoy Park area of Beaver Creek; a new four-person high speed
lift to serve Peak 7 at Breckenridge; replacing the Peru lift at
Keystone with a six-person high speed chairlift; replacing the
Peachtree lift at Crested Butte with a new three-person fixed-grip
lift; and an upgrade of the four-person Quantum lift at Okemo with

debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest
rates as we had approximately $0.8 billion of net variable-rate
debt outstanding as of July&nbsp;31, 2021, after consideration of
$400.0 million in interest rate swaps which convert variable-rate
debt to fixed-rate debt. A 100-basis point change in LIBOR would
cause our annual interest payments on our net variable-rate debt to
change by approximately $8.4 million. Additionally, the annual
payments associated with the financing of the Canyons transaction
increase by the greater of CPI less 1%, or 2%. The fluctuation in
our debt service requirements, in addition to interest rate and
inflation changes, may be impacted by future borrowings under our
credit agreements or other alternative financing arrangements we
may enter into. Our long term liquidity needs depend upon operating
results that impact the borrowing capacity under our credit
agreements, which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital
expenditures, the flexibility of investment activities and the
ability to obtain favorable future financing. We can respond to
liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic
environment, including the COVID-19 pandemic, by managing our
capital expenditures, variable operating expenses, the timing of
new real estate development activity and the payment of cash
dividends on our common stock.</span></div>

Repurchase Program</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
share repurchase program is conducted under authorizations made
from time to time by our Board of Directors. On March 6, 2006, our
Board of Directors initially authorized the repurchase of up to
3,000,000 shares of Vail Resorts common stock (“Vail Shares”) and
later authorized additional repurchases of up to 3,000,000
additional Vail Shares (July 16, 2008) and 1,500,000 Vail Shares
(December 4, 2015), for a total authorization to repurchase shares
of up to 7,500,000 Vail Shares. During Fiscal 2021, we did not
repurchase any Vail Shares. Since the inception of this stock
repurchase program through&nbsp;July 31, 2021, we have repurchased
6,161,141 Vail Shares at a cost of approximately $404.4 million. As
of July 31, 2021, 1,338,859 Vail Shares remained available to
repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. Pursuant to
the Third Amendment and as discussed above, we are prohibited from
repurchasing shares of common stock during the Financial Covenants
Temporary Waiver Period unless (x) no default or potential default
exists under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and (y) the Company
has liquidity (as defined above) of at least $300.0 million, and
the aggregate amount of dividends paid and share repurchases made
by the Company during the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver
Period may not exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal quarter. Vail
Shares purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as
treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under
the Company’s share award plan. Repurchases under the program may
be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by
applicable laws, and subject to market conditions and other
factors. The timing, as well as the number of Vail Shares that may
be repurchased under the program, will depend on several factors,
including our future financial performance, our available cash
resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future,
the restrictions in our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, prevailing
prices of Vail Shares and the number of Vail Shares that become
available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive. The
share repurchase program has no expiration date.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
announced on April 1, 2020 that we would be suspending the
declaration of our quarterly dividend in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Additionally, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, we are
prohibited from paying any dividends during the Financial Covenants
Temporary Waiver Period unless (x) no default or potential default
exists under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and (y) the Company
has liquidity (as defined above) of at least $300.0 million, and
the aggregate amount of dividends paid and share repurchases made
by the Company during the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver
Period may not exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal quarter. During
Fiscal 2021, we did not pay cash dividends. On September 22, 2021,
our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.88 per share
payable on October 22, 2021 to stockholders of record as of October
5, 2021. Additionally, a Canadian dollar equivalent dividend on the
Exchangeco Shares will be payable on October 22, 2021 to the
shareholders of record as of October 5, 2021. We expect to fund the
dividend with available cash on hand and will do so pursuant to the
restrictions under the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver Period.
The amount, if any, of dividends to be paid in the future will
depend on our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs,
overall financial condition, restrictions contained in our Vail
Holdings Credit Agreement, future prospects for earnings and cash
flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of
Directors.</span></div>

Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, Secured Net Funded Debt to Adjusted
EBITDA ratio and the Interest Coverage ratio (each as defined in
the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement); for the Whistler Credit
Agreement, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the Whistler Credit
Agreement); and for the EPR Secured Notes, Maximum Leverage Ratio
and Consolidated Fixed Charge Ratio (each as defined in the EPR
Agreements). In addition, our financing arrangements limit our
ability to make certain restricted payments, pay dividends on or
redeem or repurchase stock, make certain investments, make certain
affiliate transfers and may limit our ability to enter into certain
mergers, consolidations or sales of assets and incur certain
indebtedness. Our borrowing availability under the Vail Holdings
Credit Agreement is primarily determined by the Net Funded Debt to
Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is based on our segment operating
performance, as defined in the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement. Our
borrowing availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement is
primarily determined based on the commitment size of the credit
facility and our compliance with the terms of the Whistler Credit
Agreement.</span></div>

test during such period (as discussed above).</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We

debt instruments as of July&nbsp;31, 2021. We expect that we will
continue to meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in
effect in our credit agreements throughout the year ending July 31,
2022; however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
meet such financial covenants. If such covenants are not met, we
would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks
participating in our credit agreements. There can be no assurance
that such waiver or amendment would be granted, which could have a
material adverse impact on our liquidity.</span></div>

are tested for impairment at least annually as of May&nbsp;1. Our
testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset
impairment consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of
those assets with their net carrying values. If the net carrying
value of the assets exceed their estimated fair value, an
impairment will be recognized for indefinite-lived intangible
assets, including goodwill, in an amount equal to that excess;
otherwise, no impairment loss is recognized. During Fiscal 2021, we
performed quantitative analyses of our reporting units and

respective carrying values.</span></div>

value determinations require considerable judgment and are
sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a
result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment
test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and
ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units
may include such items as: (1)&nbsp;prolonged adverse weather
conditions resulting in a sustained decline in guest visitation;
(2) a prolonged weakness in the general economic conditions in
which guest visitation and spending is adversely impacted
(particularly with regard to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); and
(3)&nbsp;volatility in the equity and debt markets which could
result in a higher discount rate.</span></div>

historical performance and current expectations have generally
resulted in estimated fair values of our reporting units in excess

possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the
future. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an
impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be
material. As of July&nbsp;31, 2021, we had $1,781.0 million of

expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and
judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions

arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and
expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the
interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions. The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We
recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a
two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position
for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to
estimate and measure the largest tax benefit that is cumulatively
greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts,
as this requires us to determine the probability of various
possible outcomes. This evaluation is based on factors including,
but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in
tax law, interpretation of tax law, effectively settled issues
under audit and new audit activity. A significant amount of time

difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value
of the net assets acquired or the excess of the aggregate estimated

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class=

our management to make significant estimates and assumptions,
especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for
intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed and contingent
consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the
assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been
reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical
experience and information obtained from the management of the
acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we
have acquired include but are not limited to determination of
weighted average cost of capital, market participant assumptions,
royalty rates, terminal multiples and estimates of future cash
flows to be generated by the acquired assets. In addition to the
estimates and assumptions applied to valuing intangible assets
acquired, the determination of the estimated fair value of
contingent consideration, including estimating the likelihood and
timing of achieving the relevant thresholds for contingent
consideration payments, requires the use of subjective judgments.
We estimate the fair value of the Park City contingent
consideration payments using an option pricing valuation model
which incorporates, among other factors, projected achievement of
specified financial performance measures, discounts rates and
volatility for the respective business.</span></div>

if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable
assumptions that a marketplace participant would use. While we use
our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our
estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a
result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year
from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to
goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final
determination of the estimated fair values of assets acquired or
liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent
adjustments would be recorded in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
recognize the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of
acquisition as part of the consideration transferred to acquire a
business. The liability associated with contingent consideration is
remeasured to fair value at each reporting period subsequent to the
date of acquisition taking into consideration changes in financial
projections and long-term growth rates, among other factors, that
may impact the timing and amount of contingent consideration
payments until the term of the agreement has expired or the
contingency is resolved. Increases in the fair value of contingent
consideration are recorded as losses in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations, while decreases in fair value are recorded as
gains.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature. In
particular, revenue and profits for our North America mountain and
most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and
historically result in losses from late spring to late fall.
Conversely, peak operating seasons for our NPS concessionaire
properties, our mountain resort golf courses and our Australian
resorts’ ski season generally occur during the North American
summer months while the North American winter months result in
operating losses. Revenue and profits generated by NPS
concessionaire properties summer operations, golf operations and
Australian resorts’ ski operations are not sufficient to fully
offset our off-season losses from our North American mountain and
other lodging operations. During Fiscal 2021, approximately 82% of
total combined Mountain and Lodging segment net revenue (excluding
Lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll
costs) was earned during the second and third fiscal quarters.
Therefore, the operating results for any three-month period are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any
subsequent quarter or for a full year (see Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).</span></div>

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm89">Interest Rate Risk.</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Our exposure to market risk is limited primarily
to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate
indebtedness. At July&nbsp;31, 2021, we had approximately $0.8
billion of net variable rate indebtedness (after taking into
consideration $400.0 million in interest rate swaps which converts
variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt), representing approximately
28% of our total debt outstanding, at an average interest rate
during Fiscal 2021 of approximately 2.8%. Based on variable-rate
borrowings outstanding as of July&nbsp;31, 2021, a 100-basis point
(or 1.0%) change in LIBOR would result in our annual interest
payments on our net variable-rate debt changing by $8.4 million.
Our market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying
interest rates.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm89">Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">We are exposed to currency
translation risk because the results of our international entities
are reported in local currency, which we then translate to U.S.
dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As
a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates, in particular
the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar compared to the U.S.
dollar, affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative
effect on our financial results. Additionally, we have foreign
currency transaction exposure from an intercompany loan to Whistler
Blackcomb that is not deemed to be permanently invested, which has
and could materially change due to fluctuations in the Canadian
dollar exchange rate. The results of Whistler Blackcomb and our
Australian ski areas are reported in Canadian dollars and
Australian dollars respectively, which we then translate to U.S.
dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We
do not currently enter into hedging arrangements to minimize the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our
operations.</span></div>

Company's management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
the Company’s consolidated</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Our
audits of the consolidated</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated</span> <span class="mtn20210731htm18">financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the consolidated</span> <span class="mtn20210731htm18">financial
statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</span></div>

Internal Control over Financial Reporting</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the</span></div>

<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class=

control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect

to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.</span></div>

<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from
the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a

Value Measurement of the Contingent Consideration</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">As
described in Note</span> <span class="mtn20210731htm18">10</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">to the consolidated</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">financial statements, the Company
has established a liability of $29.6 million as of July&nbsp;31,
2021 for additional amounts that management believes are likely to
be paid to the previous owner of Park City (the “Contingent
Consideration”). The Company remeasures the Contingent
Consideration to fair value at each reporting date until the
contingency is resolved. The estimated fair value of Contingent
Consideration includes the future period resort operations of Park
City in the calculation of EBITDA on which participating contingent
payments are made, which is determined on the basis of estimated
subsequent year performance, escalated by an assumed long-term
growth factor and discounted to net present value. Fair value is
estimated using an option pricing valuation model. As described by
management, key assumptions in determining the fair value under
this model included future period Park City EBITDA, discount rate
and volatility.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
principal considerations for our determination that performing
procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the Contingent
Consideration is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant
judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement,
which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating
audit evidence related to management’s significant assumptions for
the future period Park City EBITDA, discount rate, and volatility;
and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming
our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating
to management’s fair value measurement of the Contingent
Consideration including controls over the Company’s significant
assumptions. The procedures also included, among others, testing
management’s process for developing the fair value measurement and
evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related
to the future period Park City EBITDA, discount rate, and
volatility. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the
future period Park City EBITDA, discount rate, and volatility
involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were
reasonable considering (i) the current and past period EBITDA
performance of Park City; (ii) the consistency with external market
data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the
evaluation of the Company’s discount rate and volatility
assumptions.</span></div>

Resorts, Inc. (“Vail Resorts”) is organized as a holding company
and operates through various subsidiaries. Vail Resorts and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) operate in three
business segments: Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate. The Company
refers to “Resort” as the combination of the Mountain and Lodging
segments.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In the
Mountain segment, the Company operates the following 37 destination
mountain resorts and regional ski areas:</span></div>

respective local markets.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Additionally, the Mountain segment includes
ancillary services, primarily including ski school, dining and
retail/rental operations, and for the Company’s Australian ski
areas, including lodging and transportation operations. Several of
the resorts located in the United States (“U.S.”) operate primarily
on federal land under the terms of Special Use Permits granted by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. The operations
of Whistler Blackcomb are conducted on land owned by the government
of the Province of British Columbia, Canada within the traditional
territory of the Squamish and Lil’wat Nations. The operations of
the Company’s Australian ski areas are conducted pursuant to
long-term leases and licenses on land owned by the governments of
New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Okemo, Mount Sunapee and
Stowe operate on land leased from the respective states in which
the resorts are located and on land owned by the
Company.</span></div>

luxury hotels and condominiums under its RockResorts brand; other
strategic lodging properties and a large number of condominiums
located in proximity to the Company’s North American mountain
resorts; National Park Service (“NPS”) concessionaire properties
including the Grand Teton Lodge Company (“GTLC”), which operates

<span class="mtn20210731htm18">The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries for which the Company has a controlling
financial interest. Investments in which the Company does not have
a controlling financial interest, but has significant influence,
are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.</span></div>

"mtn20210731htm18">The Company records trade accounts receivable in
the normal course of business related to the sale of products or
services. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a
specific reserve analysis and on a percentage of accounts
receivable and takes into consideration such factors as historical
write-offs, the economic climate and other factors that could
affect collectability. Write-offs are evaluated on a case by case
basis.</span></div>

"mtn20210731htm89">Inventories —</span> <span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">The Company’s inventories consist primarily of
purchased retail goods, food and beverage items and spare parts.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable

The Company records a reserve for estimated shrinkage and obsolete
or unusable inventory.</span></div>

carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that improve the
functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are
capitalized. When property, plant and equipment is retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in
income from operations. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term
or estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line method, including property, plant and
equipment under finance leases, generally based on the following
useful lives:</span></div>

fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds the carrying amount, which includes an evaluation as to
whether there have been significant changes to macro-economic
factors related to the reporting unit or intangible asset that
could materially impact fair value. If it is determined, based on
qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not less than
carrying amount, or if significant changes to macro-economic
factors related to the reporting unit or intangible asset have
occurred that could materially impact estimated fair values since
the previous quantitative analysis was performed, a quantitative
impairment test would be required, in which the Company would
determine the estimated fair value of its reporting units using
discounted cash flow analyses and determine the estimated fair
value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income
approach. The quantitative test for impairment consists of a
comparison of the estimated fair value of the assets with their net
carrying values. If the net carrying amount of the assets exceed
its estimated fair value, an impairment will be recognized for
indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill, in an amount
equal to that excess. If the net carrying amount of the assets does
not exceed the estimated fair value, no impairment loss is
recognized.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company determined that there were no impairments of goodwill or
definite and indefinite-lived assets for the years ended July 31,
2021 and 2019. As a result of COVID-19 and the impact it has had on
the Company’s operations during the year ended July 31, 2020, the
Company determined that the estimated fair value of its Colorado
resort ground transportation company reporting unit within its
Lodging segment no longer exceeded its carrying value. As further
discussed in Note 8, Supplementary Balance Sheet Information, the
Company recognized an impairment of approximately $28.4 million
related to its Colorado resort ground transportation company during
the year ended July 31, 2020, which was recorded within asset
impairments on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations,
with a corresponding reduction to goodwill, net of $25.7 million
and to intangible assets, net and property, plant and equipment,
net of $2.7 million. See Note 8, Supplementary Balance Sheet
Information, for additional information. The Company determined
that there were no other impairments of goodwill or definite and
indefinite-lived assets for the year ended July 31,
2020.</span></div>

"mtn20210731htm18">The Company evaluates potential impairment of
long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying
amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the sum of the
expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, is less than the net
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in
the amount by which the net carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its estimated fair value. The Company determined that there were no
impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended July 31, 2021
and 2019. As discussed above, the Company recorded an impairment to
long-lived assets related to its Colorado resort ground
transportation company during the year ended July 31, 2020. The
Company determined that there were no other impairments of
long-lived assets for the year ended July 31, 2020.</span></div>

Estate Cost of Sales —</span> <span class="mtn20210731htm18">Costs
of real estate transactions include direct project costs, common

Company’s entities operating outside of the United States is the
principal currency of the economic environment in which the entity
primarily generates and expends cash, which is generally the local
currency. The assets and liabilities of these foreign operations
are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance
sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated using the
weighted average exchange rate for the period. Translation
adjustments from currency exchange, including intercompany
transactions of a long-term nature, are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’
equity. Intercompany transactions that are not of a long-term
nature are reported as gains and losses within “segment operating
expense” and for intercompany loans within foreign currency gain
(loss) on intercompany loans on the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations.</span></div>

for certain liabilities, including medical claims, workers’
compensation claims, third-party loss contingencies and property
taxes, among other items. The Company estimates the probable costs
related to these liabilities that will be incurred and records that
amount as a liability in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, the Company records, as applicable, receivables
related to insurance recoveries for loss contingencies if deemed
probable of recovery. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted as
the facts and circumstances change. The Company records legal costs

July&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $38.6 million, $41.6 million

<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm89">Income
Taxes —</span> <span class="mtn20210731htm18">Income tax expense
includes U.S. tax (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. The
Company’s provision for income taxes is based on pre-tax income,
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in
estimates with regard to uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets and for operating loss and tax credit
carrybacks or carryforwards. The change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax provision or
benefit for the period. Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to
the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment. The
Company’s deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent it is deemed to be more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions
based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of available
evidence indicates that it is “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained, on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company
to estimate and measure the largest tax benefit that is
cumulatively greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties accrued in connection
with uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of
income tax expense. See Note 11, Income Taxes, for more
information.</span></div>

equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other current assets,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the EB-5 Development
Notes (as defined in Note 6, Long-Term Debt) approximate fair value
due to their short-term nature. The fair value of amounts
outstanding under the Company’s credit agreements and the Employee
Housing Bonds (as defined in Note 6, Long-Term Debt) approximate
book value due to the variable nature of the interest rate
associated with the debt. The estimated fair values of the 6.25%
Notes and the 0.0% Convertible Notes (each as defined in Note 6,
Long-Term Debt) are based on quoted market prices (a Level 2
input). The estimated fair value of the EPR Secured Notes (as
defined in Note 6, Long-Term Debt) has been estimated using an
analysis based on current borrowing rates for debt with similar
remaining maturities and ratings (a Level 2 input). The carrying
values, including any unamortized premium or discount, and
estimated fair values of the 6.25% Notes, 0.0% Convertible Notes

<span class="mtn20210731htm18">The Company’s financial instruments
that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The Company
places its cash and temporary cash investments in low risk accounts
with high-quality credit institutions. The Company does not enter
into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts and notes
receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and
markets in which the Company transacts business, as well as their
dispersion across many geographical areas. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral, but does require advance deposits on certain
transactions.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm89">Accounting for Hedging Instruments —</span>
<span class="mtn20210731htm18">From time to time, the Company
enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash
flows associated with variable-rate borrowings by converting the
floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate (the “Interest Rate
Swaps”). As of July&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company hedged the future
cash flows associated with $400.0 million of the principal amount
outstanding of its Vail Holdings Credit Agreement (as defined in
Note 6, Long-Term Debt), which were designated as cash flow hedges.
The accounting for changes in fair value of hedging instruments
depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. In order to qualify for
hedge accounting, the underlying hedged item must expose the
Company to risks associated with market fluctuations and the
financial instrument used must reduce the Company’s exposure to
market fluctuation throughout the hedge period. Changes in
estimated fair value of the Interest Rate Swaps are recorded within
change in estimated fair value of hedging instruments on the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and such
change was recorded as a gain (loss) of $12.8 million and
($22.5)&nbsp;million during the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Such amounts are reclassified into interest
expense, net from other comprehensive income during the period in
which the hedged item affects earnings. During the year ended July
31, 2021 $5.4&nbsp;million was reclassified into interest expense,
net from other comprehensive income. As of July&nbsp;31, 2021, the
estimated fair value of the Interest Rate Swaps was a liability of
approximately $12.9 million and was recorded within other long-term
liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the
impact of the underlying cash flows associated with the Interest
Rate Swaps are recorded within interest expense, net on the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10, Fair
Value Measurements, for more information.</span></div>

identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain
substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the
asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. Generally, the
Company classifies a lease as a finance lease if the terms of the
agreement effectively transfer control of the underlying asset;
otherwise, it is classified as an operating lease.&nbsp;For
contracts that contain lease and non-lease components, the Company
accounts for these components separately. For leases with terms
greater than twelve months, the associated lease right-of-use
(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the
estimated present value of future lease payments over the lease
term at commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide a
readily determinable implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses an
estimated incremental borrowing rate to discount the future minimum
lease payments. For leases containing fixed rental escalation
clauses, the escalators are factored into the determination of
future minimum lease payments. The Company includes options to
extend a lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will
be exercised. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
See&nbsp;Note 4, Leases, for more information. The Company adopted
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 on August 1, 2019,
which required lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities
arising from all leases on the balance sheet, using the modified
retrospective transition method as provided by the standard.
Accordingly, reporting periods beginning on August 1, 2019

<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
Reporting.” The ASU provides optional transition guidance, for a
limited time, to companies that have contracts, hedging
relationships or other transactions that reference the London
Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate which
is expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.
The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for
applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other
transactions if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this
update are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31,
2022. The amendments in this update may be applied as of any date
from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is
subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within
an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020,
up to the date that the financial statements are available to be
issued. All other amendments should be applied on a prospective
basis. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect that
the adoption of this standard will have on its Consolidated
Financial Statements, but does not expect it will have a material
effect.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span><br></span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Accounting for
Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”
which simplifies the guidance in Accounting Standards Codifications
(“ASC”) 470-20, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options” by
reducing the number of accounting separation models for convertible
instruments, amending the guidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and
Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” for certain contracts
in an entity’s own equity that are currently accounted for as
derivatives, and requiring entities to use the if-converted method
for all convertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share
(“EPS”) calculation. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods
within those fiscal years (the Company’s first quarter of the
fiscal year ending July 31, 2023). Early adoption is permitted, but
no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020,
including interim periods within those fiscal years (the Company’s
first quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2022). This
standard allows for a modified retrospective or fully retrospective
method of transition. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-06 on August
1, 2022 and expects to use the modified retrospective method, and
therefore financial information for periods before August 1, 2022
will remain unchanged. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2020-06,
the Company expects that it will reclassify the equity component of
its 0.0% Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 6, Long-Term Debt)
to long-term debt, net, and it will no longer record interest
expense related to the amortization of the debt
discount.</span></div>

revenue is derived from a wide variety of sources, including, among
other things: lift revenue, which includes sales of lift tickets
and pass products; ski school revenue, which includes the revenue
derived from ski school operations; dining revenue, which includes
both casual and fine dining on-mountain operations; retail sales
and equipment rentals; and other on-mountain revenue, which
includes private ski club revenue (which includes both club dues

advertising revenue, municipal services and lodging and
transportation operations at the Company’s Australian ski areas.
Revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are
satisfied as control of the good or service (e.g. access to ski
areas, provision of ski school services, etc.) is transferred to
the customer, except for the Company’s retail sales and dining
operations revenues which are recognized at a point in time when
performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of
the underlying goods to the customer. The Company records deferred
revenue primarily related to the sale of pass products. Deferred
revenue is generally recognized throughout the ski season as the

determine usage patterns is not available, such as in the case of
new product offerings, deferred revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis throughout the ski season until sufficient
historical usage patterns are available. The Company also includes

revenue is derived from a wide variety of sources, including, among

rooms; revenue from hotel dining operations; transportation revenue
which relates to the Company’s Colorado resort ground
transportation operations; and other lodging revenue which includes
property management services, managed properties other costs
reimbursements, private golf club revenue (which includes both club
dues and amortization of initiation fees), and golf course fees.
Lodging revenue also includes managed hotel property payroll cost
reimbursements related to payroll costs at managed properties where
the Company is the employer, which are reimbursed by the owner with
no added margin. Therefore, these revenues and corresponding
expenses have no net effect on the Company’s operating income or
net income. Other than revenue from dining operations, lodging

<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">For
certain contracts that have an original term length of one year or
less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such
contracts and does not consider the time value of money. For
contracts with an expected term in excess of one year, the Company
has considered the provisions of Topic 606 in determining whether
contracts contain a financing component. The Company presents
revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations,
net of taxes, when collected from its customers that are remitted
or payable to government taxing authorities, except when products
are inclusive of taxes where applicable.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">As a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company closed its North
American destination mountain resorts, regional ski areas and
retail stores early during the 2019/2020 North American ski season,
beginning on March 15, 2020. Subsequently, the Company announced a
credit offer for all existing 2019/2020 North American ski season
pass product holders to purchase 2020/2021 North American ski
season pass products at a discount (the “Credit Offer”). The Credit
Offer discounts ranged from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 80%
for season pass holders, depending on the number of days the pass
holder used their pass product during the 2019/2020 season and a
credit, with no minimum, but up to 80% for multi-day pass products,
such as the Epic Day Pass, based on total unused days. The Credit
Offer was considered a contract modification which constituted an
option to purchase an additional pass product for 2019/2020 North
American ski season guests and, as such, represented a separate
performance obligation to which the Company allocated a transaction
price of approximately $120.9&nbsp;million. As a result, the
Company deferred $120.9&nbsp;million of pass product revenue, which
would have otherwise been recognized as lift revenue during the
year ended July 31, 2020. The Credit Offer expired on September 17,
2020 and the Company recorded $15.4&nbsp;million as lift revenue
during the three months ended October 31, 2020, which was the
amount of Credit Offer discounts which were not redeemed. The
remaining deferred revenue associated with the Credit Offer was
recognized as lift revenue primarily during the 2020/2021 North
American ski season, as the performance obligations were
satisfied.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">In
April 2020, the Company announced Epic Coverage, which is included
with the purchase of all pass products for no additional charge.
Epic Coverage offers refunds to pass product holders if certain
qualifying personal or resort closure events occur before or during
the ski season. The estimated amount of refunds reduce the amount
of pass product revenue recognized by the Company. To estimate the
amount of refunds under Epic Coverage, the Company considers (i)
historical claims data for personal events, (ii) provincial, state,
county and local COVID-19 regulations and public health orders,
(iii) the ability for the Company’s pass holders to make
reservations on their preferred days (for only the 2020/2021 North
American ski season, during which the Company utilized a
reservation system) and (iv) the Company’s operating plans for its
resorts. The Company believes the estimates of refunds are
reasonable; however, actual results could vary materially from such
estimates, and such estimates will be remeasured at each reporting
date.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Additionally, for the 2020/2021 North American
ski season, the Company introduced Epic Mountain Rewards, a program
which provides pass product holders a discount of 20% off
on-mountain food and beverage, lodging, group ski school lessons,
equipment rentals and more at the Company’s North American owned
and operated Resorts. Epic Mountain Rewards constitutes an option
to our guests to purchase additional products and services from us
at a discount and as a result, the Company allocates a portion of
the pass product transaction price to these other lines of
business.</span></div>

Obligations</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Several of the Company’s contracts with
customers include multiple performance obligations, primarily
related to bundled services such as ski school packages, lodging
packages and events (e.g. weddings and conferences). For such
contracts, revenue is allocated to each distinct and separate
performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling
price. The standalone selling prices are generally based on
observable prices charged to customers or estimated based on
historical experience and information.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm89">Contract Balances</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Contract liabilities are recorded primarily as
deferred revenues when payments are received or due in advance of
the Company’s performance, including amounts which may be
refundable. The deferred revenue balance is primarily related to
accounts receivable or cash payments recorded in advance of
satisfying the Company’s performance obligations related to sales
of pass products prior to the start of the ski season, private club
initiation fees and other related advance purchase products,
including advance purchase lift tickets, multiple-day lift tickets,
ski school lessons, equipment rentals and lodging advance deposits.
Due to the seasonality of the Company’s operations, its largest
deferred revenue balances occur during the North American pass
product selling window, which generally begins in the third quarter
of its fiscal year. Deferred revenue balances of a short-term
nature were $456.5 million and $256.4 million as of July&nbsp;31,
2021 and 2020, respectively, and the increase was primarily due to
an increase in pass product sales for the 2021/2022 North American
ski season as compared to the prior year from the beginning of the
selling season through each respective fiscal year-end, due largely
to the lack of any spring sales deadlines in fiscal year 2020 as a
result of COVID-19. Deferred revenue balances of a long-term
nature, comprised primarily of long-term private club initiation
fee revenue, were $121.0&nbsp;million and $121.9 million as of
July&nbsp;31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $232.8
million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue
balance as of July&nbsp;31, 2020. As of July&nbsp;31, 2021, the

<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=

receivables when the right to consideration is unconditional. Trade
receivable balances were $345.4 million and $106.7 million as of
July&nbsp;31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Payments from customers
are based on billing terms established in the contracts with
customers, which vary by the type of customer, the location and the
products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when
payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services
and customer types, contracts require payment before the products
are delivered or services are provided to the customer. Impairment
losses related to contract assets are recognized through the
Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts analysis. Contract asset
write-offs are evaluated on an individual basis.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm89">Costs
to Obtain Contracts with Customers</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company expects that credit card fees and sales commissions paid in
order to obtain season ski pass products contracts are recoverable.
Accordingly, the Company records these amounts as assets when they
are paid prior to the start of the ski season. As of July&nbsp;31,
2021, $3.1 million of costs to obtain contracts with customers were
recorded within other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Deferred credit card fees and sales commissions are
amortized commensurate with the recognition of season ski pass
revenue. The Company recorded amortization of $17.8 million, $11.0
million and $10.6 million for these costs during the years ended
July&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which were
recorded within Mountain and Lodging operating expenses on the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class=
"mtn20210731htm18">Utilizing the practical expedient provided for
under Topic 606, the Company has elected to expense credit card
fees and sales commissions related to non-season ski pass products
and services as incurred, as the amortization period is generally
one year or less for the time between customer purchase and
utilization. These fees are recorded within Mountain and Lodging
operating expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company’s operating leases consist primarily of commercial and
retail space, office space, employee residential units, vehicles
and other equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is or
contains a lease at contract inception or modification. The
Company’s lease contracts generally range from&nbsp;1
year&nbsp;to&nbsp;60&nbsp;years, with some lease contracts
containing one or more lease extension options, exercisable at the
Company’s discretion. The Company generally does not include these
lease extension options in the initial lease term as it is not
reasonably certain that it will exercise such options at contract
inception. In addition, certain lease arrangements contain fixed
and variable lease payments. The variable lease payments are
primarily contingent rental payments based on: (i) a percentage of
revenue related to the leased property; (ii) payments based on a
percentage of sales over contractual levels; or (iii) lease
payments adjusted for changes in an index or market value. These
variable lease payments are typically recognized when the
underlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in
the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same
line item as the expense arising from the respective fixed lease
payments. The Company’s lease agreements may also include non-lease
components, such as common area maintenance and insurance, which
are accounted for separately. Future lease payments that are
contingent and non-lease components are not included in the
measurement of the operating lease liability. The Company’s lease
agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or
restrictive covenants. Lease expense related to lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit
rate. As a result, the Company measures the lease liability using
an estimated incremental borrowing rate which is intended to
reflect the rate of interest the Company would pay on a
collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments under similar terms. The Company applies the estimated
incremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on the
economic environment associated with the lease.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company uses the long-lived assets impairment guidance to determine
recognition and measurement of an ROU asset impairment, if any. The
Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that
require a reassessment.</span></div>

Company computes the effect of dilutive securities using the
treasury stock method and average market prices during the period.
The number of shares issuable on the exercise of share based awards
that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per
share because the effect of their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive totaled approximately 2,000, 2,000 and 4,000 for the
years ended July&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">On
December 18, 2020, the Company completed an offering of
$575.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of 0.0%
Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 6, Long-Term Debt). The
Company is required to settle the principal amount of the 0.0%
Convertible Notes in cash and has the option to settle the
conversion spread in cash or shares. The Company uses the treasury
method to calculate diluted EPS, and if the conversion value of the
0.0% Convertible Notes exceeds their conversion price of $407.17
per share of common stock, then the Company will calculate its
diluted EPS as if all the notes were converted and the Company
issued shares of its common stock to settle the excess value over
the conversion price. The par value of the 0.0% Convertible Notes
is required to be settled in cash and therefore would not impact
diluted EPS. However, if reflecting the 0.0% Convertible Notes in
diluted EPS in this manner is anti-dilutive, or if the conversion
value of the notes does not exceed their initial conversion amount
for a reporting period, then the shares underlying the notes will
not be reflected in the Company’s calculation of diluted EPS. For
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2021, the average price of Vail Shares
did not exceed the conversion price and therefore there was no
impact to diluted EPS during those periods.</span></div>

component represents a debt discount of $109.7&nbsp;million and
will be amortized to interest expense, net over the term. The
balance of the unamortized debt discount was $97.2&nbsp;million as
of July&nbsp;31, 2021. The carrying amount of the equity component
representing the conversion option was approximately
$109.7&nbsp;million and was determined by deducting the initial
fair value of the liability component from the total proceeds of

the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities of approximately
$27.5&nbsp;million related to the equity component of the 0.0%

lesser of (i) three times the percentage increase in the Consumer
Price Index (“CPI”) or (ii) a capped index (the “Capped CPI
Index”), which is 1.75% for the Hunter Mountain Secured Note and
1.50% for all other notes. The EPR Agreements provide for
affirmative and negative covenants that restrict, among other
things, the ability of Peak Resorts and its subsidiaries to incur
indebtedness, dispose of assets, make distributions and make
investments. In addition, the EPR Agreements include restrictive
covenants, including maximum leverage ratio and consolidated fixed
charge ratio. An additional contingent interest payment would be
due to EPR if, on a calendar year basis, the gross receipts from
the properties securing any of the individual EPR Secured Notes
(the “Gross Receipts”) are more than the result (the “Interest
Quotient”) of dividing the total interest charges for the EPR
Secured Notes by a specified percentage rate (the “Additional
Interest Rate”). In such a case, the additional interest payment
would equal the difference between the Gross Receipts and the
Interest Quotient multiplied by the Additional Interest Rate. This
calculation is made on an aggregated basis for the notes secured by
the Jack Frost, Big Boulder, Boston Mills, Brandywine and Alpine
Valley ski resorts, where the Additional Interest Rate is 10.0%; on
a standalone basis for the note secured by the Company’s Mount Snow
ski resort, where the Additional Interest Rate is 12.0%; and on a
standalone basis for the note secured by the Company’s Hunter
Mountain ski resort, where the Additional Interest Rate is 8.0%.
Peak Resorts does not have the right to prepay the EPR Secured
Notes. The EPR Secured Notes were recorded at their estimated fair
value in conjunction with the acquisition of Peak Resorts on
September 24, 2019. The EPR Agreements grant EPR certain other
rights including (i) the option to purchase the Boston Mills,
Brandywine, Jack Frost, Big Boulder or Alpine Valley resorts, which
is exercisable no sooner than two years and no later than one year
prior to the maturity dates of the applicable EPR Secured Note for
such properties, with any closings to be held on the applicable
maturity dates; and, if EPR exercises the purchase option, EPR will
enter into an agreement with the Company for the lease of each
acquired property for an initial term of 20 years, plus options to
extend the lease for two additional periods of ten years each; (ii)
a right of first refusal through 2021, subject to certain
conditions, to provide all or a portion of the financing associated
with any purchase, ground lease, sale/leaseback, management or
financing transaction contemplated by Peak Resorts with respect to
any new or existing ski resort properties; and (iii) a right of
first refusal through 2021 to purchase the Company’s Attitash ski
resort in the event the Company were to desire to sell the Attitash
ski resort. To date, EPR has not exercised any such purchase
options.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">On
September 24, 2019, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Peak Resorts, Inc. (“Peak
Resorts”) at a purchase price of&nbsp;$11.00 per share or
approximately $264.5 million. In addition, contemporaneous with the
closing of the transaction, Peak Resorts was required to pay
approximately&nbsp;$70.2&nbsp;million of certain outstanding debt
instruments and lease obligations in order to complete the
transaction. Accordingly, the total purchase price, including the
repayment of certain outstanding debt instruments and lease
obligations, was approximately&nbsp;$334.7 million, for which the
Company borrowed approximately $335.6 million under the Vail
Holdings Credit Agreement (see Note 6, Long-Term Debt) to fund the
acquisition, repayment of debt instruments and lease obligations,
and associated acquisition related expenses. The acquired resorts
include: Mount Snow in Vermont; Hunter Mountain in New York;
Attitash Mountain Resort, Wildcat Mountain and Crotched Mountain in
New Hampshire; Liberty Mountain Resort, Roundtop Mountain Resort,
Whitetail Resort, Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania;
Alpine Valley, Boston Mills, Brandywine and Mad River Mountain in
Ohio; Hidden Valley and Snow Creek in Missouri; and Paoli Peaks in
Indiana. The Company assumed the Special Use Permits from the U.S.
Forest Service for Attitash, Mount Snow and Wildcat Mountain, and
assumed the land leases for Mad River and Paoli Peaks. The
acquisition included the mountain operations of the resorts,
including base area skier services (food and beverage, retail and
rental, lift ticket offices and ski school facilities), as well as
lodging operations at certain resorts.</span></div>

transaction were primarily related to trade names and property

purposes. The Company assumed various debt obligations of Peak
Resorts, which were recorded at their respective estimated fair

process of estimating the fair value of the property, plant, and

related to replacement cost and physical condition at the time of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate
estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized is attributable
primarily to expected synergies, the assembled workforce of Stevens
Pass and other factors, and is expected to be deductible for income
tax purposes. The Company recognized&nbsp;$1.2&nbsp;million&nbsp;of
acquisition related expenses associated with the transaction within

Additionally, the Company determined that certain long-lived assets
of its Colorado resort ground transportation company were not
recoverable. As a result, the Company recognized impairments of
goodwill of approximately $25.7 million and intangible assets and
long-lived assets of $2.7 million, which were recorded within asset
impairments on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations
during the year ended July 31, 2020.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company estimated the fair value of its Colorado resort ground
transportation company reporting unit based on an analysis of the
present value of future cash flows (an income approach). The
significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model
included the Company’s weighted average cost of capital for the
reporting unit, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of
growth, all of which are significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.
The Company’s assumptions were based on the actual historical
performance of the reporting unit, taking into account the
weakening of operating results and the expected continuation of
operating results for transportation services. As a result of this
impairment, the Company’s Colorado ground transportation company
had no remaining goodwill recorded as of July 31,
2020.</span></div>

includes the future period resort operations of Park City in the
calculation of EBITDA on which participating contingent payments
are made, which is determined on the basis of estimated subsequent
performance, escalated by an assumed long-term growth factor and
discounted to net present value. The Company estimated the fair
value of the Contingent Consideration payments using an option
pricing valuation model. Key assumptions included a discount rate
of 11.0%, volatility of 17.0% and future period Park City EBITDA,
which are unobservable inputs and thus are considered Level 3
inputs. The Company prepared a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the
effect that changes on certain key assumptions would have on the
estimated fair value of the Contingent Consideration. A change in
the discount rate of 100 basis points or a 5% change in estimated
subsequent year performance would result in a change in the
estimated fair value within the range of approximately
$3.8&nbsp;million to $5.3&nbsp;million.</span></div>

compared to estimated results for Park City in the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2021, resulting in an increase in the expected
payment for the year, as well as accretion resulting from the
passage of time, resulting in an estimated fair value of the

CARES Act also provides refundable employee retention credits and

result of wages paid to employees who were not providing services.

ownership changes pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Reform Act

changes; however, management believes the full benefit of those
carryforwards will be realized prior to their respective expiration

valuation allowance on $3.9&nbsp;million of the historical non-U.S.
NOL carryforwards, as the Company has determined that it is more

property. The operations of Falls Creek and Hotham are conducted on
land under leases granted by the Governor of the State of Victoria,
Australia and its dependencies, which initially commenced in 1991

over the shorter of their economic lives or the term of the lease.
For the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company
recorded lease expense (including Northstar, Perisher, Falls Creek
& Hotham and Mad River Mountain), excluding executory costs,
related to these agreements of $58.7 million, $58.8 million and
$57.8 million, respectively, which is included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 4, Leases, for
additional information regarding the Company’s leasing
arrangements.</span></div>

Company is self-insured for claims under its U.S. health benefit
plans and for the majority of workers’ compensation claims in the
U.S. Workers compensation claims in the U.S. are subject to stop
loss policies. The self-insurance liability related to workers’
compensation is determined actuarially based on claims filed. The
self-insurance liability related to claims under the Company’s U.S.
health benefit plans is determined based on analysis of actual
claims. The amounts related to these claims are included as a
component of accrued benefits in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities (see Note 8, Supplementary Balance Sheet
Information).</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm61"><span class="mtn20210731htm134">From
October 2020, several named plaintiffs filed respective complaints
against the Company on behalf of the same or similar purported
classes of current and former employees of the Company. The
complaints generally allege violations of federal and state laws
governing employee wage and hours practices, and seek damages in
the form of unpaid wages, related penalties and other damages. The
Company has proposed a settlement agreement to resolve these
complaints, which is pending finalization and court approval. As a
result, the Company recorded a charge of $13.2&nbsp;million during
the year ended July 31, 2021, which is included in general and
administrative expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Operations.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company is also a party to various lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of business. Management believes the Company has adequate
insurance coverage and/or has accrued for all loss contingencies
for asserted and unasserted matters deemed to be probable losses
and reasonably estimable. As of July&nbsp;31, 2021 and 2020, the
accruals for the above loss contingencies (excluding the
employment-related litigation) were not material individually or in
the aggregate.</span></div>

<div class="mtn20210731htm97"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company has three reportable segments: Mountain, Lodging and Real
Estate. The Company refers to “Resort” as the combination of the
Mountain and Lodging segments. The Mountain segment includes the
operations of the Company’s mountain resorts/ski areas and related
ancillary activities. The Lodging segment includes the operations
of the Company’s owned hotels, RockResorts, NPS concessionaire
properties, condominium management, Colorado resort ground
transportation operations and mountain resort golf operations. The
Real Estate segment owns, develops and sells real estate in and
around the Company’s resort communities. The Company’s reportable
segments, although integral to the success of the others, offer
distinctly different products and services and require different
types of management focus. As such, these segments are managed
separately.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company reports its segment results using Reported EBITDA (defined
as segment net revenue less segment operating expenses, plus or
minus segment equity investment income or loss, and for the Real
Estate segment, plus gain or loss on sale of real property). The
Company reports segment results in a manner consistent with
management’s internal reporting of operating results to the chief
operating decision maker (Chief Executive Officer) for purposes of
evaluating segment performance.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">Items
excluded from Reported EBITDA are significant components in
understanding and assessing financial performance. Reported EBITDA
should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or
substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents
or other financial statement data presented in the Consolidated
Financial Statements as indicators of financial performance or
liquidity.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company utilizes Reported EBITDA in evaluating the performance of
the Company and in allocating resources to its segments. Mountain
Reported EBITDA consists of Mountain net revenue less Mountain
operating expense plus or minus Mountain equity investment income
or loss. Lodging Reported EBITDA consists of Lodging net revenue
less Lodging operating expense. Real Estate Reported EBITDA
consists of Real Estate net revenue less Real Estate operating
expense plus gain or loss on sale of real property. All segment
expenses include an allocation of corporate administrative expense.
Assets are not used to evaluate performance, except as shown in the
table below. The accounting policies specific to each segment are
the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.</span></div>

Program</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">On
March&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up
to 3,000,000 Vail Shares. On July&nbsp;16, 2008, the Company’s
Board of Directors increased the authorization by an additional
3,000,000 Vail Shares, and on December 4, 2015, the Company’s Board
of Directors increased the authorization by an additional 1,500,000
Vail Shares for a total authorization to repurchase up to 7,500,000
Vail Shares. The company did not repurchase any Vail Shares during
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2021. During the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2020, the Company repurchased 256,418 Vail Shares (at
a total cost of $46.4 million). During the year ended July&nbsp;31,
2019, the Company repurchased 353,007 Vail Shares (at a total cost
of $85.0 million). Since inception of this stock repurchase program
through July&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 6,161,141
shares at a cost of approximately $404.4 million. As of
July&nbsp;31, 2021, 1,338,859 Vail Shares remained available to
repurchase under the existing share repurchase program, which has
no expiration date. Vail Shares purchased pursuant to the
repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used
for issuance under the Company’s employee share award
plan.</span></div>

Plan</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
Company has a share award plan (the “Plan”) which has been approved
by the Company’s stockholders. Under the Plan, up to 4.4 million
shares of common stock could be issued in the form of options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share
units, performance shares, performance share units, dividend
equivalents or other share-based awards to employees, directors or
consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates. The
terms of awards granted under the Plan, including exercise price,
vesting period and life, are set by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. All share-based awards (except for
restricted shares and restricted share units) granted under the
Plan have a life of ten years. Most awards vest ratably over three
years; however, some have been granted with different vesting
schedules. Of the awards outstanding, none have been granted to
non-employees (except those granted to non-employee members of the
Board of Directors of the Company) under the Plan. At July&nbsp;31,
2021, approximately 2.8 million share based awards were available
to be granted under the Plan.</span></div>
<div class="mtn20210731htm92"><span class="mtn20210731htm18">The
fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)
granted in the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were
estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option
valuation model that applies the assumptions noted in the table
below. A lattice-based model considers factors such as exercise
behavior, and assumes employees will exercise equity awards at
different times over the contractual life of the equity awards. As
a lattice-based model considers these factors, and is more
flexible, the Company considers it to be a better method of valuing
equity awards than a closed-form Black-Scholes model. Because
lattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of
assumptions for inputs, those ranges are disclosed. Expected
volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s
stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate equity award
exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model;
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise
behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The
expected term of equity awards granted is derived from the output
of the option valuation model and represents the period of time
that equity awards granted are expected to be outstanding; the
range given below results from certain groups of employees
exhibiting different behavior. The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the equity award is based on the
United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant.</span></div>
