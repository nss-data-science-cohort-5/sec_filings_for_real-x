The program, which is open-ended in duration, allows us to make repurchases from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchases are at our discretion, subject to applicable law, share availability, price and our financial performance, among other considerations. Under the current repurchase program adopted on June 13, 2018, we have repurchased 434,171 common shares through March 4, 2022 at an average price per share of $9.45 and an aggregate cost of $4.1 million, and have authorization to repurchase an additional 765,829 common shares. We did not purchase any shares under this program during the year ended December 31, 2021.</span></div>
